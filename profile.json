It's just a mod that adds the white ash particle from the Basalt Deltas biome to the underground to simulate dust! After all, the air wouldn't be 100% clear in a real mineshaft :p\n\nNow to the nitty gritty: It works by checking if the player has the sky above them while being below sea level and then scales the amount of particles based on depth.\n\nIt has a config system that you can access using Mod Menu, most things you can change in-game, but to change the particle you'll need to open the config file manually :)\nAs a note, it doesn't activate in the Lush Caves biome, since it already has it's own particles :p\n\nThis was inspired by Dylanstime in the [moonflower Discord server](​https://www.moonflower.gg/discord), thanks for the idea!\n![Screenshot of Discord message from Dylanstime, reading: \"is it possible to copy the code for the dust in the basalt deltas and put them in caves but smaller amounts and slower\nor maybe a mod that adds effects similar to it in other biomes\"](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/443/991/image_2022-03-26_163011.png)\n \n\n# Dependencies\nCave Dust requires the Fabric API but everything else Cave Dust needs is included.

EMI only requires standard, first party Fabric/Quilt APIs\n\n\n## What does EMI stand for?\nIt doesn't, it's not an acronym. Or maybe it's an acronym without a meaning?

Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily. Fluids are virtual so they can only exist in modded container specifically for them\n \n\n-Dispenser utilities:\nSome code that allows to easily register dispenser behaviors without overriding already existing ones. Also comes with builtin spawn egg and block placement behaviors\n\n ","published":"2022-06-21T07:56:14.814685Z","updated":"2023-11-18T03:03:54.225402Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":299690,"followers":280,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["2vA7za0R","HnzRVHve","VFJlAomw","TdrX8qHu","ND0jV6Ba","wMvYwhzf","YZ1c6V1Y","7KfOaFNC","n36VFZgj","hjpH6YTS","TZqLAjc4","SNOfTsuq","BpwfruOR","ARzMom8z","bSd7CaVX","bYgSpZNX","sFlS58kl","MunWW5CV","ip1Rzqeo","VYcJMwhh","77PCqM0x","EWKHMqhL","48KdkfGF","LHQnKJPr","SUVVyNOn","iUir8IFb","CAaiQgHc","mMuXnmER","5CAvXUDI","Y9Yo8h10","Cwn2eAQI","1ZP9jeJp","JwDuktzc","aNax4jyH","RIqvRzdD","ANPz3UX0","wkQInAdt","5vaqrscY","rvr9aKfC","mzGChtna","dVl8oHMC","qfTdrUeL","KbGlKdHo","S3OlMtz3","zGJuxvK4","MwH6iRuX","GSlj8ip7","4x52sEBq","ZZzULVfd","sS7WRpan","hbIxgIk3","gO19W71w","4jTOJ2ZI","oZ6GRhj8","VhZo5bM4","TQkusKt9","368y55MX","8ZMdWvwz","r4wBdvIX","f5gtva35","8hghdRdh","GxCfXdHN","jwSm2KiR","F0NN8t9F","h4yyiupT","hzwrgZl8","gA9vpijP","KdTmjJVb","HjrG1F0r","fwqQVTzC","3WC47wPk","XMHhMXZd","G82otMKn","bjFaEsLT","Pi6AVDbd","1R2xmUor","Ti5Z22lJ","IVC9YnMt","gmoV0tyd","2PY4BLur","zLddLJPF","5ZwEaffq","ZTvfXhRv","NF5WIl7b","yOVUWvRf","5KCmgfbm","9OTYJk7a","v3BxhM1S","BHmy40Mt","AWhKa778","uiUPREjo","VoARfnSD","Xxa877fY","u857rKSQ","rznUqNwu","cmz3IAL2","gdtVX62P","7wxkhoX2","sMEl6tss","2Uz8dh1y","OuwCxc61","5N5K36U1","jEMUwADf","xAJqgTD0","96TZidKH","FWVFXkyg","7JKL4wL5","ihYnBDx3","ROwff1j7","yrhbhfSn","ZHuO4LiU","pFeITkZi","y04tJAwP","YkBLE8Oq","LTmKAyph","UxWlwJoD","kyMgJhmx","pKTlrvKt","Ovxp7vPe","NtrvPW5Z","Z6GA4zUd","kP7srLfi","Xv8cPrF8","ebGaMVM5","KlX1F156","SV4rUTK3","9OGPgOeF","M1JtNLFm","50P4wZoB","kDFjJOMB","lIrlI8Zz","JXolKGKT","GTSq9qXH","ZVLcOJJE","BdAPfRTo","XWjG3vWP","hZxT2b1p","uBnHFMR2","I1r3C7CG","sE2tTJLZ","gUtSDU9U","Gp0CQft9","MG6apqgk","J5E9L4AG","8j22jNcF","tAcvUB1b","X46edIfU","OKx9Elr9","uOIpFARl","LkOHvzOj","FmgUqwxg","FLKgQQZH","sgNQlLLv","Bwn3tASZ","1tR7YwgX","n665AUFc","JBBeBPK6","S9PrveOz","sNFzpvYl","WXwbgZvj","IeVioShx","mvCZhlZo","o7oqq3Lh","vjQmGhyI","9dcfZ4i9","mCdzmJZC","hj1UnmZ2","idIlWA9u","PXyqXIbn","fQhx5ml2","fia9z4h4","cKg5hnPJ","mHeZr8dp","IPLC6g62","3NoxJuBX","pglf5GDl","SrPhRlSQ","vnTrMyMb","vehbL6pP","9Cgq74lp","EYDLWwqS","Hl9ja4Gl","Z8apZ6lb","UrzlfaAz","4fEnQ2ua","JoEQ35TB","XlRP5PMn","7cwLznr1","C86Th6Cw","N1eo0JjB","TkEXwUpi","R3HUuRlb","yvWnUxeS","gK3ltYEo","9eKKGLgl","81iXq8Ua","ifaZqqbi","wAEWAPPs","X0mWyHDn","3z15qPRG","yKc5hWwB","613mgPdm","6WCyArcu","FreWFSqP","QzsElbGY","g0I9zd9f","QYOUgJFZ","g5fu5BKB","jx8jTIax","7FTjFbHI","6UdNaxrX","QEr4oCmZ","whxnG6tI","lsj3hYsg","v8shmez8","dE1OqDFw","buvzG5Eh","LOutWSjK","Ta3wPFEM","f6naP7j6","h6yrGow9","nkCKWwmU","QYPLYuej","Eax5TmfX","NkDayjzv","BsdtnGcc","i8LcMgkg","GFChSR1Q","5Zza2cPD","mSQCkfvX","FaHHZhWB","CSWnYqKU","olYe4Pvg","8BzRkauW","hiH76w7r","XYaisWHj","9T5izdE9","s6wGYEq5","j6jDosOf","wFJ6kLiM","XtugKOOJ","uqfvv0ms","PM712gqw","2O4lu5JH","G4l3R3Pb","MXuvNr3i","KJQ6UUBP","cGKy75i2","7O9YniXA","WBx7Ddq6","LGgzYsHU","IUITd8aF","LhoPcVBA","dfWWDslj","5MTISIoq","vBIzpz3C","95iGLvuV","JmKTlMTk","RNUEccJ3","Sn17BhlX","jlMUHPST","4Pn6H6LU","YAbYzYmZ","Fc74Sq3o","xFsTt0Ku"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/twkfQtEc/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"IUITd8aF","project_id":"twkfQtEc","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"1.19.2-2.3.5","version_number":"1.19.2-2.3.5","changelog":"fixed

If you are a user, this means this mod does nothing on it's own and you should only install it when using another mod that depends on it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Install the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/configured-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Configured</strong></span></a> mod by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/mrcrayfish\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>MrCrayfish</strong></span></a> if you want in-game configuration!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">This port became necessary as I wasn't able to find an existing config api on Fabric which suited my needs, also I have a bunch of code built on top of Forge's api, so just porting the api was the easiest solution. Any other dev seeking to use the Forge config api on Fabric to maintain their project(s) on both loaders is welcome to use this library. Instructions on how to add Forge Config API Port to your development workspace can be found on the GitHub page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">If you're using a multiloader Gradle setup for your workspace, e.g. as demonstrated <a href=\"https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>here</strong></span></a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/jaredlll08\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Jared</strong></span></a>, Forge Config API Port is especially useful, as it can be directly added to the common sub project, so that all Forge config features can be used in any sub project, mod loader specific code only being required once when registering configs. It's really neat, believe me!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><del>Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code>, or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</del></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><del>Default in-game configuration will be added when the related <a href=\"https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/8874\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>PR</strong></span></a> is finalized and merged into Forge. Since the approach the Forge team is taking for configs screens is rather basic, I'm also planning on providing my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for Fabric, to offer in-game configuration in a more user-friendly and feature packed manner.</del></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">More information concerning the licensing of this project and additional information for other developers can be found on the GitHub repo.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/M1Yd5EZ.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>🏆 Credits:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Developing Forge Config API Port was helped and inspired by:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The whole Forge team, they really did a great job putting together this config api for Forge.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/M1Yd5EZ.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; line-height: 36px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/fuzs_/projects\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzs_&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=curseforge&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"97\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/Fuzss\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzss&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"97\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2l26SuCmCNSCPefpfbCX7Q\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzs&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=youtube&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"89\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Fusseel\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=@Fusseel&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=twitter&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"124\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fusseel\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=u/Fusseel&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=reddit&amp;logoColor=white\" alt=\"Reddit\" width=\"130\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzs%200212&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=discord&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"127\" height=\"28\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/M1Yd5EZ.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>","published":"2021-12-03T10:23:02.288424Z","updated":"2023-09-21T22:19:29.117770Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":628129,"followers":756,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["VpvE1h2H","16w4kT84","3h8hgyqP","AxEvkjh5","notOZAjX","GJ0aBxFN","2eL7Opm5","JpOqHq5p","jwtFMyhT","eYeUbc3T","86FCTo9M","rXgI0k5P","h7joEojU","WjwjuiDp","p2C10JUL","4JaArhTS","XGKEYlsw","K7z34XSj","vlllTHgw","akDg87hC","JdloDJit","KjE2hCJv","XhjJZ5uE","fI5AsaV4","CkM0mGHX","H1LkHOeQ","hRGdglV6","FtpEL8G9","tlNCwMwZ","sJryrwj9","tqRbIeBK","bh0uyJuX","alqrny5V","cjmImt9R","6J0K7FyD","3VCgXZ79","TFLCxTVc","mFoJ8qnh","ou26o2qg","MkqOn4Yc","2TybfFU8","oYUxEUGk","nlcnay8A","1cG1sI8e","ewYccCIi","CtENDTlF","f5d9VI72"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ohNO6lps/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"3VCgXZ79","project_id":"ohNO6lps","author_id":"rHdGpxOA","featured":false,"name":"[FABRIC] [1.19.2] ForgeConfigAPIPort-v4.2.11","version_number":"4.2.11","changelog":"# Changelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog].\n\n## [v4.2.11-1.19.2] -

With Create, the game isn't played inside a bunch of UIs, it challenges you to setup contraptions of animated components working together in many possible arrangements.</p>\n<p>Create's visual in-game documentation called 'Ponder' will guide you though all added mechanics and gadgets.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: In order to be able to see all recipes required in Create, consider installing a Recipe Viewer mod. Create has full support for <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei\">JEI</a>, <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/rei\">REI</a>, and <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/emi\">EMI</a>.

category.](https://i.imgur.com/0ew58PW.png)\n\n### EMI Loot\n\nEMI Loot is a plugin for the [EMI Recipe and Item viewer](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) that displays loot tables for chests, blocks , and mobs.\n\n \n*EMI Loot is in beta! Please expect features to change and be added as development continues.*\n\n*This mod is for Fabric and Quilt. A Forge port is not planned at this time.*\n\n*All credit goes to EmilyPloszaj for the creation of EMI itself. This is just a plugin.*\n\n[![Join the Discord](https://i.imgur.com/iXATO6K.png)](https://discord.gg/zDbaYmUba2)\n\n#### Wiki\n\nFor guides on how to use the data-driven systems in EMI Loot, please see [the wiki](https://github.com/fzzyhmstrs/EMI_loot/wiki)\n\n#### Notable Features\n\n- Chest loot is sorted by percentage and includes drops added to the loot tables by mods.\n- If a chest has too many loot options to fit onto the screen, EMI Loot will condense the output into lists of items stacked by same-percentage. Hovering over a certain percentage list will show the possible stacks you can expect to get at that probability.\n- Stack sizes shown represent the average item count you can expect to pull at a time (before factoring in the probability).\n- Block drops have been added. These views show the various drops available, split into different categories based on any particular circumstances needed to get that drop (Silk Touch, Shears, etc).\n- Mob drops have been added. Shows drops available split into categories based on circumstances needed to acquire them (only when a mob is on fire, extra with looting, etc)\n\n\n#### Features to come\n- Implement resource-pack driven system for defining custom conditions and how to parse them.\n- Add in fishing and other gameplay loot\n\n\n","published":"2022-09-25T22:13:18.112945Z","updated":"2023-07-25T02:26:56.602764Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":148970,"followers":154,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["g010jnKd","YvsiPoNW","sMYv0WU4","rEZyE6x3","hME9LTtZ","iiGhUAPe","UoqcWBE6","dsAxQzyr","R27L5Wrs","dDsA0q1m","AnKDZCEA","nkW4UzlO","OeVpkByV","byhOHBwi","pFHgMv8g","FzY7HsGk","WLrmskq7","TM0YFork","h5EhjjmQ","nH2jMxUZ","finLaORs","8VxvWtcW","b7JoJE05","p0Ugm9eu","odt1Mqrz","YZu0lWye","48q801AN","vWadFDyM","ge7Vbplt","9rpAPYB9","Xn48U1HI","Rp2bjZ9t","mPCfosCw","x6vIf3HD","tR4xqoxp","7rjmttb6","7fjkgVEh"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qbbO7Jns/dec44ad1547e774b6fce97a5268f6ff6309ec40a.png"},"version":{"id":"x6vIf3HD","project_id":"qbbO7Jns","author_id":"ANKRvkxl","featured":false,"name":"EMI Loot 0.6.5+1.19","version_number":"0.6.5+1.19","changelog":"* Fixed Entities in Mob Loot not appearing in their boxes.\n* Fixed some numbers not rounding correctly (2.3423454 -> 2.34)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-25T02:24:55.650575Z","downloads":12379,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"127b1fed9382889037ee4bfe147fc889adc1520e","sha512":"6f9ded7e0a64c0c0bd1e931f3f5bbf978e4ee447a74abb528506d183fd7bd804f951dad46dce17d7acc1660f692347648dfa32eec931c055b3e5b36cbcb8da76"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qbbO7Jns/versions/x6vIf3HD/emi_loot-0.6.5%2B1.19.jar","filename":"emi_loot-0.6.5+1.19.jar","primary":true,"size":331971,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"ciMqRO3M","project_id":"fRiHVvU7","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"A6CuhMKl","user":{"id":"ANKRvkxl","username":"fzzyhmstrs","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72876796?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-04-13T21:42:13.876320Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"emi_loot-0.6.5+1.19.jar"},"mods\\autotag-2.0.0+1.19.jar":{"sha512":"cf79536afdcb65947dc64b354fdc7ec1e0aaf4531cfefff5d8513a45323f3211a85088eb831833050047febd18904d5332cd67e4033e8043fa0ab24faac14048","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"8FdYDHF5","slug":"autotag","project_type":"mod","team":"CuOWTsQ5","title":"AutoTag","description":"Automatically populates some item, block and other tags (for mod compatibility)","body":"This is a purely technical mod with the aim to increase inter-mod compatibility. By \"purely technical\" I mean that it won't add any content to your game.\n\n### The Problem\n\nMod creators are encouraged to use tags where possible, e.g. when creating a recipe. If mods are supposed to work together though, they should all share a same base of common \"conventional\" tags, which group certain items together. Not all developers add their items to common tags though, which means that a person playing with many mods or a mod pack creator might need to create long lists of all items which fulfill certain criteria to add them to specific tags.\n\n### The Solution\n\nUpon loading a world, this mod will automatically populate some tags based on code conditions, covering all modded content as well.\n\nIt's mostly relevant for mod pack creators who need / want to configure mods by adding to specific tags - this allows them to e.g. easily add all armor items to a tag, because they'll all be bundled in `c:armor`.\n\nAs another example, all items which are equippable in the head slot will land in a tag called `c:head_equippables`:\n\n![Screenshot of the `c:head_equippables` tag](https://i.imgur.com/2E36FZS.png)\n \n\n### Additional Information\n\nFor an overview of the tags the mod currently adds, as well as the blacklist option via datapacks, [view the README on GitHub](https://github.com/apace100/autotag/blob/1.18/README.md).\n\nIf you have any suggestions for new tags, feel free to post them in the comments or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/apace100/autotag/issues)!\n\n\n\nI hope this mod helps someone and makes their life a bit easier. :)\n\n----\n\nThe mod icon is a composition of modified icons created by Lorc and Delapouite, found on game-icons.net.","published":"2022-04-27T08:43:12.453767Z","updated":"2023-07-07T18:57:46.548975Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":38343,"followers":45,"categories":["library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["zTLVD3Ir","iLNm8Z6p","50kM3UvN","VoyNngbb","sXJE2Hnq","cC57ynct","ocD9XA8D"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8FdYDHF5/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"VoyNngbb","project_id":"8FdYDHF5","author_id":"g6LkRuia","featured":true,"name":"1.19.x: AutoTag 2.0.0","version_number":"2.0.0+1.19","changelog":"* Updated to 1.19.x.\n* Now is split into two mods internally: AutoTag API and AutoTag Convention.

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2023-10-31T07:08:36.481240Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2006367,"followers":3787,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"kwjHqfz7","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"5.0.3 (Fabric/Quilt)","version_number":"5.0.3-fabric","changelog":"- Fix crash on recent Quilt builds","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-11-26T16:42:52.101249Z","downloads":283866,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"efbea36712322c71aee547ebc71b3644947e40bfa01d721fce5d5ba2db4aa6867e6a76f43d46e33ae8a2672f300bfc5b96510e164b1dd09cfae9cba0a195252d","sha1":"4a124f8205e39b84a156db2d1e435c5708328d7b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/kwjHqfz7/ferritecore-5.0.3-fabric.jar","filename":"ferritecore-5.0.3-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":119275,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-5.0.3-fabric.jar"},"mods\\fabric-seasons-2.3+1.19.jar":{"sha512":"089eac2a3bd5d474dde65f8f82249276fe3d94a2300b67b96c2ce8d76219bdd38f39cd0c1e9d0461e92044d8db76d5493567beb709bc8019f63c9b16720fc151","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"KJe6y9Eu","slug":"fabric-seasons","project_type":"mod","team":"qABOlhS9","title":"Fabric Seasons","description":"A simple mod that adds seasons to the game, dynamically changing biomes as you play.","body":"<center>\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/WszJUGI.png\">\n\nA simple mod that adds seasons to the game, dynamically changing biomes as you play.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Ol1Tcf8.png\" width=\"143\" height=\"50\">\n\n</center>\n\n### Description\n\nFabric Seasons adds **four seasons** to Minecraft, each lasting 28 in-game days (configurable). The **current season** is defined by the **world time** (using `/time set 0` will reset to day 1 of spring). Each season has its own changes; during the spring, biomes will mostly try to match their original characteristics.\n\nThe mod has 2 components:\n- **Server:** If installed on the server biomes will have different temperatures. (this enables weather changes like snowing and block freezing in the winter). The server component also contains seasonal crops, allowing crops to grow at different speeds according to the season.\n- **Client:** If installed on the client biomes will have different colormaps according to the current season. This is just a visual change and it'll not physically impact your world in any form.\n\nTo get the full experience it's recommended that you install the mod on both the server and the client.\n\n### Seasonal Biomes\n\nBiomes have **different temperatures** depending on the current **season**:\n\n- Cold Biomes will have rain in the summer\n- Temperate Biomes will have snow in the winter\n- Tropical Biomes will have a steady season all year round\n- Hot Biomes will have a rainy season in the winter\n\nDepending on the **original** temperature/precipitation of the **biome**, this behavior can change. \n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NdYBkgC.gif\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gH5seb5.gif\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Qs600XR.gif\">\n</center>\n\n### Seasonal Crops\n\nCrops will grow at **different speeds** depending on the current **season**.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/75gqPqS.png\">\n</center>\n\nEach **individual crop** will have a **pre-configured** growth **speed** for one of the four seasons, this is controlled by a **datapack** and can be changed by the user if they want.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/dR4OYPT.png\">\n</center>\n\n### Other Information\n\nFor bug reporting please proceed to the mod's GitHub repository: [https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons](https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons)\n\nIf you have any other questions or suggestions, feel free to call me on Discord @D4rk#0693  \nYou can find me in the Cafeteria Development guild.\n\n[![](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/707435077679841350/embed.png?style=banner2&v=2)](https://discord.com/invite/G4PjhEf)","published":"2021-05-09T15:41:27.109292Z","updated":"2023-08-12T09:38:01.813799Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":234978,"followers":606,"categories":["adventure","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.17-pre1","1.17-rc1","1.18.2","1.18-rc4","1.19","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["LhCaMIzy","jQoWa0il","zQt9Dd2v","McebIuW7","gtoXC9cr","t3cqWJpS","ZSlExvBh","nBxZtduO","k55LHPVG","hNV4laag","UBlv1O6X","JoW6p4c5","tXjlq5P9","SgKuDqln","UYBTrmgB","tjP6OtOn","FWErjNOd","Gil5sfVD","G7yrUl8Y","866aPKAj","k9JfRwVM","3wVgEG0u","7EU0UwXc","rLlocL2I","5yFOnFEL","QlPte8FN","dJtxMqxE","5TNKN9aR","sX1BCX14","hp6m6aJl","uMEzKato"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KJe6y9Eu/7ce47fcb4242493ad069789298400b14f27737ad.png"},"version":{"id":"5TNKN9aR","project_id":"KJe6y9Eu","author_id":"TPRVvJKm","featured":false,"name":"Fabric Seasons 2.3","version_number":"2.3+1.19","changelog":"A changelog can be found at https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons/commits/","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-12T09:21:10.374632Z","downloads":17935,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"b00a0cd1ef4706c2fc4c99839722289949778c26","sha512":"089eac2a3bd5d474dde65f8f82249276fe3d94a2300b67b96c2ce8d76219bdd38f39cd0c1e9d0461e92044d8db76d5493567beb709bc8019f63c9b16720fc151"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KJe6y9Eu/versions/5TNKN9aR/fabric-seasons-2.3%2B1.19.jar","filename":"fabric-seasons-2.3+1.19.jar","primary":true,"size":427782,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"qABOlhS9","user":{"id":"TPRVvJKm","username":"D4rkness_King","name":"Luca Argolo","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/TPRVvJKm/icon.png","bio":"","created":"2020-12-01T01:52:35.107689Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"fabric-seasons-2.3+1.19.jar"},"mods\\trinkets-3.4.2.jar":{"sha512":"857009331f23a8fa3c64aadd23efc0de0b7710a0ec0c4bedb504550959784dd614a6fe4ddd4c19940e751bd7395ea7fb2951b7dccf2cbdf675fe3f2143b85cdc","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"5aaWibi9","slug":"trinkets","project_type":"mod","team":"F0xlmrbH","title":"Trinkets","description":"A data-driven accessory mod","body":"# Trinkets\nA data-driven accessory mod for Minecraft using Fabric.\n\n![Image of the Trinkets UI](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/images/56224f13887cdd914a9624a18eb845dae0bcdfc0.png)\n\n## About\nTrinkets adds a slot group and slot system to Minecraft. Slot groups are collections of slots for a certain body part or more vague area. By default there are 6 slot groups (head, chest, legs, feet, offhand, hand) that can have slots added to them, but more groups can be added if desired. Trinkets' UI is intuitive to use, accessible, and attempts to do away with clutter. Its system means that you'll never have a slot that's not used for anything, as mods request the slots they want.\n\nFor basic tutorials and comprehensive documentation, visit this project's [wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Home).\n","published":"2021-06-08T00:05:32.472592Z","updated":"2023-09-21T23:28:53.528734Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":291926,"followers":642,"categories":["equipment","library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.17-rc2","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["70Ajg5iP","dRgbv7A2","29Jd2Dm4","qpiOPBB9","R2UW6ejS","FdJA5sbK","DtvgyMK2","vOuy3Z5S","XqLNMi9J","WiXqMygm","oLUBJhyv","9qrmAiwv","OLwsMJv4","5zEAvqnX","A5kxdEY3","z8ProfKL","e563ycts","tJ23Vcff"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"OLwsMJv4","project_id":"5aaWibi9","author_id":"R6WsWKy9","featured":false,"name":"Trinkets 3.4.2","version_number":"3.4.2","changelog":"Added command","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-01-16T00:23:55.932644Z","downloads":115446,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"83deb9f7ab28737a5d27a57e49fe105e9053804c","sha512":"857009331f23a8fa3c64aadd23efc0de0b7710a0ec0c4bedb504550959784dd614a6fe4ddd4c19940e751bd7395ea7fb2951b7dccf2cbdf675fe3f2143b85cdc"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/versions/OLwsMJv4/trinkets-3.4.2.jar","filename":"trinkets-3.4.2.jar","primary":true,"size":238556,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"F0xlmrbH","user":{"id":"R6WsWKy9","username":"Emi","name":"Emi","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/14813658?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-10-26T21:52:52.726926Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"trinkets-3.4.2.jar"},"mods\\owo-lib-0.9.3+1.19.jar":{"sha512":"b9b5d047e1e71fb47d459198194e2e53b10db10a3ecec52db8922f821fc2465d58e0d91e2ba2c9d13a3fabbdb2d9df113200e517ed87f76ea284d4cda017fc3e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ccKDOlHs","slug":"owo-lib","project_type":"mod","team":"SH3qQlP1","title":"oωo (owo-lib)","description":"A general utility, GUI and config library for modding on Fabric and Quilt","body":"![Header](https://i.imgur.com/dal6rrf.png)\nA general utility, GUI and config library for modding on Fabric and Quilt\n \n***\n\nFeatures include:\n\n - [owo-ui](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/ui/), a fully-featured declarative UI library for building dynamic, beautiful screens with blazingly fast development times\n\n - [owo-config](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/config/), a built-in, customizable configuration system built on top of owo-ui.

Also sprinklers.","body":"Have you ever wanted to make farming more difficult for no reason? Or maybe you have a reason? Do you like taking showers?\n\nIf you answered any of these questions - doesn't even have to be a yes - then perhaps this mod is for you.\n\n \n\nMoisturization lets you control how farmland behaves around water, how crops grow, and the efficiency of bonemeal on crops.  It also provides sprinklers to saturate farmland with.\n\nI recommend using a resource pack like [this one](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/farmland-moisture-textures) so you can see how much moisture farmland has remaining.\n\nBy default, farmland now only becomes wet when right next to a block (diagonally, too).  Old-school \"villager-style\" farms will still work, but more irrigation will be required in larger farms to keep all of your farmland moist.  That is, unless you want to use...\n\nSprinklers!  The sprinkler is a new redstone device that waters farmland in a 5x5 radius around it.  Upon activation, it spews a fountain of  r e f r e s h i n g  water that moisturizes your farmland (and your skin!*).\n\n*skin enhancements not guaranteed\n\nThis mod also changes how crops grow.  By default, if a crop is not growing on moist farmland, it will turn into a dead bush.  Additionally, crops now grow at 1/7th their usual rate and bone meal only works 1/3rd of the time!\n\nHOWEVER... this mod is mostly configurable! \n\nHere's what you can currently change:\n\n- Whether crops die without water\n- The natural growth reduction of crops\n- The bone meal growth reduction of crops (including disabling crop bonemealing entirely)\n- The range at which farmland absorbs water\n- The rate at which farmland dries\n- The range of sprinklers\n\n\nIn the future, I may implement more features for this mod, so stay tuned! \n\nAs with all of my mods, you have my full permission to look at and use the source code however the license permits.  You may also use it as a learning resource for your own mods.

The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.","published":"2021-07-19T17:56:39.449041Z","updated":"2023-09-23T14:02:42.436211Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1726179,"followers":4344,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Zk2jPxcx","uTvfCUBM","mfNlBb6U","1ApUEVoW","CVUGSVU0","Rxzic9a0","D0fLM4o1","ZxoJeTLg","TpvP0qDc","lK43uDfu","Rli2nU8i","H4bOnadw","H45YVREb","mJ7WqoOY","WG5jreCt","yTfou6df","BoAba4K3","KqmHL1pI","85NvAOjQ","tMamyl08","U94NcDpV","qqiFL8NF","M7szjcI4","WTH3T2cR","oYQsfz9e","9dgIzesu","yTh7W27h","OPwFzZCT","HIQfyNd3","hfBawPLH","6UQwWURe","Lue6O9z9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"yTfou6df","project_id":"Orvt0mRa","author_id":"M6f6rkfI","featured":true,"name":"Indium 1.0.9 for Minecraft 1.19.2/Sodium 0.4.4","version_number":"1.0.9+mc1.19.2","changelog":"- Update fabric.mod.json","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-08-29T17:53:49.531788Z","downloads":376049,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"037ffe399b279f7d4d823769035da1879fa9925a1b8d959f1dd04ad6c1ed7186d61a6a5234b0c1d653dd8fcb3f1e2ecf106758149c3f20c518e1af66e729333a","sha1":"a74ab16af990cf55dd1a3b5c76eadfc9ca25e25e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/versions/yTfou6df/indium-1.0.9%2Bmc1.19.2.jar","filename":"indium-1.0.9+mc1.19.2.jar","primary":true,"size":118642,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"rAfhHfow","project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"X5s94xjx","user":{"id":"M6f6rkfI","username":"comp500","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1138417?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-03T01:13:52.122363Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"indium-1.0.9+mc1.19.2.jar"},"mods\\guarding-1.19.2+2.2.0.jar":{"sha512":"3ab6aa73f2c05bdd27ab67b5f947ceb758a85660d80d72c9da680c6a41fdfacefeb308a586497cdf6f04c1f5bf7814f4c5a31b0e39fe36b21ced93020829eecd","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"aV1COQ7a","slug":"guarding","project_type":"mod","team":"iTOj0tRW","title":"Guarding","description":"A simple mod for Fabric implementing new features to Shields to make them feel more complete.","body":"![GUARDING](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72329798/162586175-66ab50f5-7814-490c-b150-14ec7e567dd3.png)\n\n## 📕 About\nGuarding is a small-scale fabric mod that expands upon the Shield, implementing new mechanics and unique enchantments.

You can also place more than one in the same block-space.\n- A placed Hazard Diamond is **editable**. Get close to the diamond and interact with it it to open the Edit screen.\n  - Click on any of the four main quadrants to **scroll** through its display options. The colored quadrants range from 0-4 while the white quadrant has a few special symbols to choose from.\n  - The GHS pictograms are displayed below the main diamond. Click on a pictogram to **toggle** it.\n> 🔔 **Note**: You'll know if the diamond was edited successfully when the hammering sound effect plays.\n- When you're done editing a Hazard Diamond, sneak-interact on the entity while holding a honeycomb to **wax** it.\n  - Interacting with the entity at this point will bring up the same screen in an **immutable** state.\n- If you have [WTHIT](https://modrinth.com/mod/wthit) installed, you can also view the Hazard Data in the tooltip.\n\n## 📚 Library\n\n*Hazard Diamond* is primary a library mod. It allows users to create and display Hazard Data to players with or without code. Exclusively within the API, however, is the ability to open mutable screens on the client—much like the placeable entity—and listen to when edits are submitted.\n\n[Make sure to read the wiki](https://github.com/acikek/hazard-diamond/wiki) for information on how to set up and use the various development features provided by the mod.\n\n## License\n\nMIT © 2023 spadeteam","published":"2023-05-04T04:54:53.056548Z","updated":"2023-07-29T23:12:52.127125Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":980,"followers":21,"categories":["decoration","library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["pR1TUOAX","6sFgzjuf","YTUGUs6o","gAyvpduT","ooYML6Pq","iKLNSL7a","jz6rdjue","QSAMuz9m"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/L85Kwl96/0e28aa5b64cb68dd51e70fa955a9efbde25de955.png"},"version":{"id":"ooYML6Pq","project_id":"L85Kwl96","author_id":"rtyJqzhz","featured":false,"name":"1.1.0","version_number":"1.1.0+1.19.2","changelog":"- The Hazard Diamond icons now render in-world by default\n  - This can be disabled in the new config; [read about it here](https://github.com/acikek/hazard-diamond/wiki/Hazard-Diamond-Config)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-05-19T21:49:16.600377Z","downloads":108,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"19bc4915b374acaf3274ff3be6fa3f1cec6feb69fc22a267952a036873a39c05e1a605c84300b16909d971ebfe873c62a65619b57a42b8c934e34b3f6c808865","sha1":"1f4ecd84d0663d4ca1b486343fca54165764621b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/L85Kwl96/versions/ooYML6Pq/hdiamond-1.1.0%2B1.19.2.jar","filename":"hdiamond-1.1.0+1.19.2.jar","primary":true,"size":90425,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"1eAoo2KR","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":"jCCYGoIp","project_id":"6AQIaxuO","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"yIgb6c2k","user":{"id":"7rrvWf7D","username":"VirtuaLilith","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86464979?v=4","bio":"she/her, I make art because it's fun","created":"2022-06-05T23:56:08.175224Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"yIgb6c2k","user":{"id":"rtyJqzhz","username":"acikek","name":"Skye Prince","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26909391?v=4","bio":"Programmer for spadeteam.\nOrganizer for ModFest.","created":"2022-02-17T02:04:45.876387Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"hdiamond-1.1.0+1.19.2.jar"},"mods\\diet-fabric-2.0.1+1.19.2.jar":{"sha512":"2d4b2ecfbc30a258f92b8d694300f20244f6834ad257a5b763193463518b8f347ed6a4357122ffebbc8972dbf32a9c4d0b0b3d0bbeec9bfff5c128d1bfa4a5af","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"SsIkH9rZ","slug":"diet","project_type":"mod","team":"SGucjK4p","title":"Diet","description":"A customizable food group-based nutrition and diet system.","body":"Diet is a mod that facilitates the creation and management of dietary food groups in Minecraft. Diet comes with a default configuration that creates five classical food groups (fruits, grains, vegetables, proteins, and sugars). The mod is highly configurable; users and modpack developers can define their own food groups, classifications, and diet effects.\n\n## Features\n\n### Food Groups\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/BLYDcbT/diet-screen.png)\n\nFood groups are custom dietary groups that represent the types of food that you have eaten. Each group has a value ranging between 0% and 100% depending on how much of that particular category that\na player has eaten. These values increase depending on what types of food a player eats and every group gradually decays when the player uses up their hunger bar.\n\nBy default, Diet comes with five classical food groups: Fruits, Grains, Proteins, Vegetables, and Sugars.\n\nBy editing the `diet-groups.toml` configuration file in the world save's `serverconfig` folder, users and modpack developers can create their own custom food groups. Configurable options include:\n\n- Name\n- Item Icon\n- Hexcode Color\n- Ordering\n- Default Value\n- Gain Multiplier\n- Decay Multiplier\n\nPlease refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Diet/wiki) for more detailed information.\n\n### Dietary Effects\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/7vmZfpD/diet-effects.png)\n\nDietary effects are custom rewards or penalties applied to players based on certain, configurable food group values. These effects can be configured through the `diet-effects.toml` file in the world save's `serverconfig` folder.\n\nPossible effects can include any registered potion effect, vanilla and modded, as well as modifying attributes directly (i.e. increasing maximum health by an arbitrary value). The conditions for these effects are highly configurable, including checking specific values, checking only subsets of groups, applying effects cumulatively for each matching test, and much more.\n\nPlease refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Diet/wiki) for more detailed information.\n\n##

","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2023-10-01T09:40:10.683782Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":420295,"followers":1086,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","b1.7.3"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"pmMCbsN3","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.19+]

Break free from the constraints of normal hoppers.

","body":"# Omni-Hopper\n\n> Have you ever thought about why hoppers can only suck from above?\nYou could say it makes sense from a realism perspective, \nor mention it encourages creativity through limitations.\n> \n> These are all valid arguments of course.\nBut who cares about reason when you have to get an item \nfrom one machine to another in some awkward configuration, \nand you have to decipher some obscure pipe mod to insert it from below, \nor spend ages working your way up a tech tree to craft some other kind of transport method?\n> \n> Don't you wish the humble 5 iron ingot hopper would help you out in these situations?\nBut alas, it was not meant to be. \nIt seemed we would be forever shackled in chains laid upon us by lord Jeb himself.\n> \n> Until one day, the young Omni-Hopper was born. \nWith a small offering of one copper ingot, \none everyday hopper can be freed from its constraints,\nand be placed in any possible orientation!\nSurely this will change the fate of Modded Minecraftia forevermore,\nno longer shall players have to suffer under the rule of realism.\nFreedom is within our grasp!\n> \n> Add Omni-Hopper to your modpack today and free your hoppers!\n\n## Features\n\n### Omni-Hoppers\n\nThis is a variant of vanilla hoppers that can be placed in any orientation, sucking from and inserting into any side.\nIt can be crafted by combining a regular hopper with a copper ingot.\n\nPlacing an omni-hopper can be confusing at first, but it's actually quite simple.\nThe \"sucky bit\" (input) will always face *towards* the player that placed it,\nmeanwhile the \"pointy bit\" (output) will face *into the block* the player placed it on.\nThink of it like the input following the same placement logic as a piston, \nwhile the output uses the logic of a log or pillar block.\n\n![](https://github.com/enjarai/OmniHopper/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/omnihopper.png)\n\n### Floppers\n\nFloppers are another hopper variant that transports fluids instead of items.\nWhenever possible they will pick up fluids from the world using their sucky side.\n\nThey can be crafted using the same recipe as a regular hopper, \nbut replacing iron with copper and the chest with a bucket.\n\nSince they're made of copper, they can oxidize and be waxed like any other copper block.\n\n![](https://github.com/enjarai/OmniHopper/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/flopper.png)\n\n### Whoppers\n\nA basic alternative to vanilla hoppers. They operate at half the speed of a regular hopper,\nand contain only one inventory slot.\nBut they're also very cheap to craft, only requiring 5 planks and a chest.\n\nThey also don't respond to redstone, which can be a curse or a blessing depending on your needs.\n\n![](https://github.com/enjarai/OmniHopper/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/whopper.png)\n\n### Omni variants for all\n\nAll custom hopper types come with their own omnidirectional variant, \nagain crafted by combining it with a single copper ingot.\n\n![](https://github.com/enjarai/OmniHopper/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/variants.png)\n\n### Lidless Chests\n\nThese simple blocks will instantly drop any inserted items onto the ground.\nThey can face in any direction.\n\n![](https://github.com/enjarai/OmniHopper/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/lidless.png)\n\n## Examples\n\n### Basic upside-down sorter\n\nAn unconventional sorter that uses Omni-Whoppers to pull items out of a water stream from above.\nThe items are dropped into the stream using a Lidless Chest.\n\n![](https://github.com/enjarai/OmniHopper/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/sorter.png)","published":"2022-04-14T07:02:06.151124Z","updated":"2023-09-26T08:41:09.120939Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":7584,"followers":76,"categories":["storage","technology","transportation"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["TWDSyVGd","hje1xWuV","FivZFueo","HXIcAyIL","wlh1K9ta","DbLAhbeg","fU8R4Poy","otpnihCm","vxXkqTbn","EQikchiE","MtxSl9Tz","oXTngpMx","36VrfuFD","RC9NS2OB","WzI1Xogt","o7grzMIb","MHdVNl9a","DtLsUmSy","m8tUZFp9","XeaHHjdF","EI0DXyMn","atmpz4ZA"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/i2u9r3li/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"MtxSl9Tz","project_id":"i2u9r3li","author_id":"TCTaOCuS","featured":false,"name":"2.0.1

Specifically, it makes the initialization of DataFixerUpper \"lazy\" - that is, it will not immediately create the rules required to migrate data from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions until it actually needs to do so.\n\n**This mod is for Fabric/Quilt**\n\n## Compatibility\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.2 is compatible with Minecraft 1.14 through 1.18.2, and works on the client and server side.\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.3 is compatible with Minecraft 1.19 and above, however Mojang now implements the functionality LazyDFU provides on the server side. The client still initializes all DFU rules by default, so LazyDFU hooks into the native client functionality that enables DFU rule baking and turns it into a no-op.\n\n**As of Minecraft 1.19.4 and above, however, Mojang has significantly optimized DFU initialization enough that this mod is no longer necessary in many configurations. It will continue to be supported for older versions of Minecraft.**\n\n## Sponsor me!\n\nDid this mod make Minecraft playable for you? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## Why does it work?\n\nDataFixerUpper (often abbreviated to DFU) is the Minecraft component responsible for handling world upgrades from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions. DFU is initialized very early in the Minecraft startup process - in fact, it's initialized before the game window even appears. It is laughably overengineered and very slow, but it's what Mojang gives us to work with.\n\nAs part of the DFU initialization process, it caches rules required to convert from older versions to MInecraft through every version in between, up to the version of the game being launched. This process takes place in the background, but it is _extremely_ slow, as it is both CPU and memory intensive. With Minecraft 1.16.5, I have measured this process take 9 seconds on a Ryzen 9 3900X desktop (a high-end desktop CPU released in 2019) and 57 seconds on a laptop with an i5-8250U (a mid-range laptop chip from 2017).\n\nAll LazyDFU does is stop this process - it lets DFU initialize, but it will force it to not cache all these rules. As a result, the DFU rules are only compiled when a world needs to be converted. This means it is possible you may see lag spikes if LazyDFU forces the game to compile migration rules, but once complete there is no performance penalty.\n\n## Prove it to me\n\nI [recorded a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXDqJ598kKA) that shows you how effective LazyDFU is.\n\n## Comparing it to other mods\n\nIn comparison to other mods, LazyDFU has the primary advantage of being _simple_, _safe_, and having _low impact_ on the game.\n\n* LazyDFU is a very simple mod. The entire mod is about a dozen lines of code, about as uncomplicated as a mod can get, while still delivering huge benefits. (This means it's also an ideal mod to use to experiment with a new Mixin platform!)\n* LazyDFU is highly compatible and safe. LazyDFU is extremely unlikely to conflict with other mods. This mod is based on a similar patch in [Paper](https://papermc.io) that had been in use for over a year with no reported issues with migrating to newer versions of Minecraft. (Paper has since changed to replacing Mojang's data fixers with a highly optimized implementation of its own.)","published":"2021-01-04T05:14:07.259717Z","updated":"2022-06-08T01:13:18.555078Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1486566,"followers":3010,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["8tFjDrHf","aBDhdWUD","C6e265zK","4SHylIO9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/hvFnDODi/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"4SHylIO9","project_id":"hvFnDODi","author_id":"y0WF9UR5","featured":false,"name":"0.1.3","version_number":"0.1.3","changelog":"* Update to Minecraft 1.19\n* Mojang now (by default) does not build datafixer rules on servers.

This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not.

The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2023-09-22T17:07:54.581205Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2509568,"followers":3480,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.8.8","1.8.9"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"twdGLDHv","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.1-1.19.2 - Fabric","version_number":"1.6.1-mc1.19.2","changelog":"## What's Changed\n* Reworked the ray engine to fix corner cases.

You can create multiple maps on the same server address and switch between them either manually or automatically.</li>\n<li>Works in Singleplayer, Multiplayer and on Realms.</li>\n<li>Intuitive interface. Open the map screen by&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">pressing M</strong>. Move the map around with your mouse and zoom in/out using the&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">mouse wheel</strong>, similar to Google Maps. All relevant controls are listed in a tooltip on the map screen and you can customize a lot of them.</li>\n<li>Optional automatic multiple world detection on servers.</li>\n<li>Displays chunk claims and ally players from the <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-parties-and-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open Parties and Claims</a> mod.

In the waypoint menu, you can see a list of all your map waypoints from the rendered sets, interact with them with the mouse cursor, filter them by name in a text field. The menu also lets you toggle the visibility of disabled waypoints, toggle rendering all sets and change the current waypoint set. Hovering over the waypoints in the menu also acts as hovering over them on the map: they are highlighted on the map and you can use the right-click or hover controls to interact with them.</li>\n<li>An option to export a map as a PNG image file. The mod tries to export the whole map, so it might not work, if the map is millions of blocks in length. I'm planning to give more options for exporting the map in the future!</li>\n<li>Option to limit your map access by binding it to an item required in your hotbar or to be equipped. For example, add&nbsp;<em>mapItemId:minecraft:compass&nbsp;</em>anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the map will not work unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px; text-decoration: underline;\">Get Xaero's Minimap</span></a></p>\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?\n\n<p>First, exit the server and locate the Minecraft game directory that you're using to play on the server. In the game directory, go into&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/Multiplayer_[server_address]/DIM-1/[map_folder]</em>. If such doesn't exist already, create a folder called \"<strong>caves</strong>\", without the quotation marks, and go into it. Inside the caves folder, create a folder called \"<strong>-2147483648</strong>\", without the quotation marks, if such doesn't exist already. Go back into the folder that contains the \"<strong>caves</strong>\" folder and move all \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files to the&nbsp;<strong><em>caves/-2147483648</em></strong>&nbsp;folder. Feel free to delete the cache folders or also move them with the \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files.</p>\n\n### How do I set up cave mode to behave like it used to pre 1.30 before cave mode was introduced?\n\n<p>You can fully achieve this only when using the normal version of the minimap or no minimap at all. The fair-play version of the minimap now disables world map cave mode in the Nether and you can't toggle that, so it won't be exactly like it used to be.</p>\n<p>If you have Nether map data from before 1.30, please start by moving it in the correct folder as explained under \"<em>How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?</em>\" on this page.<br />After you're done with that, join a world/server and open the world map settings. Locate \"Default Cave Mode Type\" and set it to OFF and then set \"Legible Cave Maps\" to ON. Next, open the world map screen and click the cave icon in the bottom left of the screen. In the menu that opens, set the \"Cave Mode Top Y\" to absolutely any number. If you are in the overworld, set the \"Cave Mode Type\" to OFF. When you are in the Nether later, set&nbsp;\"Cave Mode Type\" to Full. The cave mode type is stored per dimension, so you can set it to Full for any nether-like dimension and keep it on OFF for anything else. You can also switch between displaying below and above bedrock roof by toggling it.</p>\n\n### Why does right-click teleportation not work for me?\n\nThe mod sends a chat command to teleport you to specific coordinates, which is _/tp @s x y z_ by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla /tp command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the world map settings with \"Map Teleport Command\". Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. There is also an option called \"Player Teleport Command\" which is used when you right click tracked players (e.g. your party from Open Parties and Claims). Teleportation to waypoints uses its own setting in the minimap mod. You can read about it on the minimap description page under FAQ.\n\n### How do I discover the map without manually walking?\n\n<p>In singleplayer, the map is loaded directly from the world save. This means that you can pregenerate the world using whatever tools you prefer, relog and use the \"Reload Regions\" option in the world map settings to fix any conflicts in the map cache. In multiplayer, there is no official way to do that. Copying cache from a singleplayer map will not work.</p>\n\n### Why are multiple worlds on the same server address/IP using and writing to the same map?\n\n<p>This mod lets you have multiple maps on the same server address. You can freely switch between maps and create new ones at any time. Map overwriting can be prevented by choosing the right \"Map Selection\" mode for the type of server that you are playing on. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you don't have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why does the world map ask for confirmation?\n\n<p>A single server address can have multiple overworlds, nethers etc. It can be due to multiple sub-servers or just multiple world saves, for example a \"Lobby\" world and a \"Game\" world. Different worlds don't have any unique identifiers on the client side, which makes it impossible to reliably differentiate between them. Because of this, the world map mod lets you have multiple world maps for each dimension on the same server address. In older mod versions, by default, map selection is <em>Manual</em>, which means that you are asked to confirm which map to use every time you switch dimensions/worlds/sub-servers. You can also choose one of the 2 automatic modes. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">don't</span> have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why can't I see my minimap waypoints on a server after the installation of the world map?\n\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic. This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting <em>Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n\n### Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. Old world map versions use a world spawn-based system to separate a server into multiple maps. This system often breaks because of servers adding custom functionality to the vanilla compass item by sending fake world spawn coordinates to your game client.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Make sure you update the mod to the latest version.</strong>&nbsp;There are now multiple map selection modes you can choose between,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;being the default one. You can now view any world map you have on the current server address. Click the bottom left icon on the world map to open the map selection menu, if it's not open by default. <strong>The top center dropdown menu allows you to select existing or create new world maps.</strong> You can hover over the map selection mode setting (bottom left) to read about how each mode works. <em>Server </em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side.&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;mode is the safest alternative and should work on every other server. There are also 2 additional automatic map selection modes when <em>Server</em> mode isn't an option. Read more about them in the tooltip of the setting.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">Old map is not in the map menu?&nbsp;</em></strong></u>This can mean 2 things: the server address has changed or the dimension IDs have changed.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the&nbsp;<u><strong class=\"bbc\">dimension ID change</strong></u>. Each dimension on the server has a separate directory in the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you begin doing anything with it.</strong>&nbsp;In older mod versions, the dimension directory name contains the server address and the dimension key, for example&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1_DIM1</em>. In newer versions the dimension directory is a sub-directory, so something like&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/DIM1.</em> For compatibility reasons, default&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">overworld, nether and the end</em>&nbsp;dimensions are named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">null, DIM-1 and DIM1</em>. Other dimensions should have their name be based on the original dimension ID, for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/minecraft$overworld_creative</em>. In 1.16+, you can see your current dimension ID on the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">F3 screen ingame</em>&nbsp;to figure out which directory is meant for which dimension (for example \"minecraft:overworld\").&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Please exit to the game title screen or close the game before editing files/directories.</em><br />Each dimension directory contains sub-directories, one for each map that you have in the dimension (for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw$default</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw-4,0,-4</em>) as well as a file named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">dimension_config.txt&nbsp;</em>that contains the actual display names of the maps. You can use the file to help you find a specific map directory that you want. Moving/copying a map directory between dimension directories should move/copy it between dimensions. You can give it a name later ingame.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">The most common case would be&nbsp;</em></strong>something like moving a map from <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/null</em></strong>&nbsp;to <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/minecraft$overworld_survival</em></strong>. It is needed when a 1.16+ server starts using a unique dimension ID for each sub-world.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\">For server address changes</strong></u>, you would first have to remove all directories inside&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;that contain the new server address. There is usually only 1 such directory if you are using the latest mod version.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the whole&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you do that. Also, exit the game at least to the title screen.&nbsp;</strong>Then you would have to rename each old server address directory (in XaeroWorldMap) to the new address, replacing ONLY the address part.</p>\n<p>Message me or leave a comment if you have questions!</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Here's the old explanation if you can't update the mod to 1.6.1 or newer:</em></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted (this has never happened as far as I know). It's likely caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection. In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the map \"resetting\".<br />If the map \"reset\" because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your map (and hope the plugin doesn't do it again):</p>\n<p>Make sure Minecraft is&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">NOT RUNNING</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>1. Go to the game directory</p>\n<p>2. Go to the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory</p>\n<p>3. Find directories that represent the dimensions you have visited on the server. These directories contain the address of the server in their name. The one that ends with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>&nbsp;is the overworld,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_dim-1</em>&nbsp;is Nether etc.</p>\n<p>4. Open the overworld directory (<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>).</p>\n<p>5. You should see multiple directories that start with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>.</p>\n<p>6. Find the one that is the biggest in file size. Copy the name of it somewhere so you don't lose it.</p>\n<p>7. Now find the newest&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>&nbsp;directory (likely the emptiest or just check the creation date). Move this directory somewhere else.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Don't delete it just yet.</strong></p>\n<p>8. Rename the directory from step 6 to the name of the backed up directory from step 7.</p>\n<p>9. Open Minecraft and test if the overworld world map is back.</p>\n<p>10. If it's not, exit Minecraft and restore the old name of the directory that you have renamed + restore the backed up folder. Reread all the steps to make sure you're doing everything right.<br />If overworld is now fixed, proceed to step 11.</p>\n<p>11. Rename and backup the directories with the same names as overworld for every other dimension that you'd like to restore.</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n### Why have my waypoints not restored after restoring the map?\n\n<p>Please read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimap description</a>&nbsp;page.

This allows for much more advanced and flexible sensors\n\n<h3>Advanced behaviours</h3>\n\nUtilise built-in, or create new behaviours based on an extensible behaviour class, which builds in callbacks, predication, cooldowns, and more.\n\n<h3>Runtime-safe behaviour modification</h3>\n\nAdd, remove, and modify behaviours dynamically from an existing entity.\n\n<h3>Optimisation</h3>\n\nSBL replaces almost the entirety of the vanilla brain system's functions, using high-efficiency functions to remove the inefficiencies in as many areas as possible of the brain. Done right, an SBL entity could be even more efficient than one using goals!\n\n<h3>Additional sensors, behaviours, and memory types</h3>\n\nSBL builds in additional modules for use in any entity, with more to come over time.\n\n<h3>Added utility functions</h3>\n\nAs well as the expected brain functionality, SBL additionally adds additional helpers, such as:\n<ul>\n<li>Optimised level entity-getter functions</li>\n<li>Developer-friendly Random library</li>\n<li>Brain interface utility for adding/removing brain content from non-SBL entities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How do I use it?</h2>\n\nThe library is documented on its <a href=\"https://github.com/Tslat/SmartBrainLib/wiki\">Wiki Page</a>\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n\nIf you have issues or want to contribute, please jump on the <a href=\"https://github.com/Tslat/SmartBrainLib/issues\">Github Page</a> and make your voice heard","published":"2022-12-17T12:17:52.593792Z","updated":"2023-10-03T09:00:25.878460Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":53847,"followers":49,"categories":["library","mobs","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["exjazZDg","71op6HqT","ysll7HpR","eO2xepQK","yg06oOBL","uvicGZEz","M7ktWGYQ","edbi1MqI","dwBqdXTr","mVxYjt2C","UV85Isda","TPUuRqId","7N07DeJa","5fHkAtan","a8k5dfeM","YtIoSE8Z","kIHNFgnN","LEkLts9l","nKzUoyO8","eyTnm1To","YuXSOitO","bLpKjCaQ","iKI7O10v","5cfIbMqV","j5XWlgk3","ItbW1raD","JI1HW5g1","l1gfkZbZ","Okj48Ibk","61jQHgGB","R8SV4kEf","diQfXwzz","TQ4ys3Av","rAWSa9XC","AzORYDU1","FH1MNWFQ","RC9fgR3J","mAriNnAC","EB0jfrC5","4XxIY1BG","F112BW8M","YJrpYN13","blvJQFdb","hww2X4x4","VgKI4whr","pcIY8pUw","QmXwJzyR"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/PuyPazRT/622163918cf3b62f4f0172962ac4205030e7074a.png"},"version":{"id":"61jQHgGB","project_id":"PuyPazRT","author_id":"GIhCykJ9","featured":false,"name":"1.9","version_number":"1.9","changelog":"https://github.com/Tslat/SmartBrainLib/commits/1.19.2","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-03-26T00:42:17.425479Z","downloads":14738,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"fdab3226a0c43abb27c27bc7c40193eb50032066","sha512":"105af1616174cb02adc772509985030ebd21bcde89a8a64256db7fec878aacfdd23d48e59a27b324b9a064ed401846aa07a6fcc4cc989ec5467f520492288262"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/PuyPazRT/versions/61jQHgGB/SmartBrainLib-fabric-1.19.2-1.9.jar","filename":"SmartBrainLib-fabric-1.19.2-1.9.jar","primary":true,"size":322170,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"DSfXxkQM","user":{"id":"GIhCykJ9","username":"Tslat","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7098525?v=4","bio":"I am person, do things.","created":"2021-07-22T02:03:12.915903Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"SmartBrainLib-fabric-1.19.2-1.9.jar"},"mods\\kubejs-fabric-1902.6.2-build.42.jar":{"sha512":"288f6d7600ccee84504a3e7b5530ece60b822a996856fb8b6ca8b79d571dc9353f6f585ecba171b4e257ec8c76edff20b312889e48a2a6a2ac83de601866e7fd","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"umyGl7zF","slug":"kubejs","project_type":"mod","team":"YlpCyjKr","title":"KubeJS","description":"Edit recipes, add new custom items, script world events, all in JavaScript!","body":"# KubeJS\n\n---\n\n## What does this mod do?\nThis mod lets you create scripts in JavaScript language to manage your server, add new blocks and items, change recipes and tags, add custom handlers for quest mods, change worldgen and more!\n\n## How to use it?\nRun the game with mod installed once. It should generate `kubejs` folder in your minecraft directory with example scripts. startup scripts only get run once when the game loads. Those are for registering items, setting up configs etc. Server/data scripts are loaded when you join a world, those are better for things like clearlag, displaying custom login messages and world/player related things in general.\n\n## Can I reload scripts?\nYes, use `/reload`. Note: Not everything is reloadable. Some things require you to restart game, some only world, some work on fly.\n\n## I don't know JavaScript / I need help with this mod\nThere's examples and pre-made scripts on [KubeJS Wiki](https://kubejs.com/).\n\n## How does this mod work?\nIt uses [Rhino](https://modrinth.com/mod/rhino), a JavaScript engine originally by Mozilla.\n\n## Ok, but what if it.. doesn't work?\nYou can

You can roll into any direction you are heading (forwards, backwards, sideways, etc...)\n\nThe combat roll ability has 4 seconds cooldown by default.  (Server side configurable)\n\nCooldown of your combat roll ability can be seen on the main UI (aka HUD). (Client side configurable)\n\nExhaust (aka hunger) is added to the player upon rolling (Server side configurable)\n\nRoll ability can only be used when player is: not using item, not jumping, not swimming.\n\n**New!** Now with invulnerability frames! (Disabled by default, can be turned on at `config/combatroll/server.json5`)\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Attributes\n\nThese new entity attributes determine the properties of the combat roll ability.\n\n`combatroll:distance` determines how far the player rolls (the default distance is 3 blocks, server configurable). For example:\n\n`/give @s leather_boots{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:distance\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:3.0, Operation:0,Slot:\"feet\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497593, -201178, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n`combatroll:recharge` determines how quickly the cooldown of the roll ability recovers. For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_leggings{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:recharge\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:0.5, Operation:1,Slot:\"legs\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497593, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n`combatroll:count` determines how many times a player can roll before having to wait for recharging (by default a player has 1 roll). For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_helmet{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:count\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:2, Operation:0,Slot:\"head\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497594, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Enchantments\nImprove various aspects of your combat roll ability with these enchantments.\n\n### Mulit-Roll\nCan be enchanted on helmets - Grants extra rolls (+1 roll / level)\n\n### Acrobat\nCan be enchanted on chests and legs - Increases the recharge speed of the roll cooldown (by +10% / level)\n\n### Longfooted\nCan be enchanted on boots - Increases the distance of your rolls (by 1 block / level).\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n\n&zwnj;\n\n### Fabric\n\nClient side settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n### Forge\n\nClient side settings can be accessed in Main Menu &gt; Mods &gt; Combat Roll &gt; Config.\n\n### Server\n\n**Server side** configuration can be found in the `config` directory, after running the game with the mod installed.","published":"2022-09-19T17:04:44.140047Z","updated":"2023-11-01T11:37:51.803688Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":72827,"followers":245,"categories":["adventure","game-mechanics","library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["qjPNxjeI","QY3g1MPa","6Y4CdZNa","ruVouh8N","fwWMS64D","Ef4UURAJ","cNuQKeYa","bEkfuXFS","azj5HSxy","pGWBRn1i","g54fQTVc","oDqrlOkT","NjDgCyxY","VXixoSQM","UF8erTuU","Ucep0Cu5","VFPcEpGA","KYboqMGf","X1F0kcns","QCPx2IS2","LvVX8D1q","7xq1zpn0","DkP5RdK3","2YI9I4TO","EDsEsJtK","aJk5QhXt","u2ibYGVH","2Ae8EJZw","WOCP3kLf","oSQPSvZH","pzCkMdkj","h13cp5Hk","SzaC8Y3W","JrSJCgLX","qiJtKPOI","kJTOmZiq","4Kt64z82","RkJWufMO","Osxa4mmc","URzpc7Lq","ouVfwhi4","JkgJLz6x","b64nmuue","jsIwSe6h","B7ZtSwe2","iG0xPWUm","vOu5WIvs","bOQ2Cikd","mSQJJvNy","91FfnPM8","UQb9qD3J","XTopJ0Id","deyBZlUs","vaBqHK19","ljjcUkWs","81E06FMa","1QeyH5IG","8Q03X6HA","Aj08MYtw","PSEQMV1l","DYKVvo9P","js1pLjSF","slz81V0J","MzRHyyTC","gLzlXMlf","NP7Nwrwq","vdae5kTA","QiWlD1U9","hJQhKVxj","RBDMFemm","EXGDg1mc","ZFOUucav","tOGQOc87","GKj5mumX","KnHNGyLj","buCwQh9G","LNxSmECr","GmitzqXs","NhqiKzjd","Iu7dNK5J","S9W5W5gZ","n5c0ilso","yr87igvi","soyzSn1W","eVyBNuwl","cIHoyOhg"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wGKYL7st/ec708f6b60ed75fceab14e0848e9906f99dd84e1.png"},"version":{"id":"gLzlXMlf","project_id":"wGKYL7st","author_id":"CUHgJfv9","featured":false,"name":"1.1.5+1.19","version_number":"1.1.5+1.19-fabric","changelog":"No changelog was specified.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-03-08T22:13:02.745668Z","downloads":19221,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"e196f10193b4587f705c377fb23942bbe609ed4ca27a926520c4a5fc6df09eacb45ac8d806b402f28048aa6f7b15254278cfeefbb87f5250fbad566890c0602f","sha1":"3b48407b3fcdbe13db38393284562a9f510213fe"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wGKYL7st/versions/gLzlXMlf/combatroll-fabric-1.1.5%2B1.19.jar","filename":"combatroll-fabric-1.1.5+1.19.jar","primary":true,"size":173599,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"o9dFD9SO","project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"hfsU4hXq","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"gedNE4y2","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"oKdlkn0S","user":{"id":"CUHgJfv9","username":"ZsoltMolnarrr","name":"Molnár Zsolt","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4989469?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-07-04T18:48:27.207892Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"combatroll-fabric-1.1.5+1.19.jar"},"mods\\PresenceFootsteps-1.6.4.jar":{"sha512":"0bd6fbc394920839802827639e5073a86948d8db48553c334969ab35c7239610b1f0c4de703f0b1fbf15859db9630fae7ef9f12fb367bf87ad8890f4fa5c5d6f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"rcTfTZr3","slug":"presence-footsteps","project_type":"mod","team":"GvrerX1T","title":"Presence Footsteps","description":"..An Overly complicated Sound Mod...","body":"_..An Overly complicated Sound Mod..._\n\n---\n\nThis is the continuation of Huricaaan (Ha3)'s original mod, maintained and updated to the latest version of Minecraft.

Every block has its own material assigned to it, and can make their own, customized sounds to better match what they're made of.\n\n---\n\n- Wooden chests are creaky and old,\n- stone is dusty and rough.\n- Piston heads sound like wood, whilst their bodies are stone,\n- even cake sounds like you might destroy if you step in the frosting!\n- Tall grass and bristles make a dry, rustling sound as you step through them,\n- Magma sounds like it's literally cooking your souls!\n\n---\n\nNot only that, but the latest version includes step sounds for certain non-block entities:\n\n---\n\nShulkers make the same creaky box noises as Shulker boxes, boats sound like wood, and armour stands creak and produce a stone stepping sound as you walk on their stone slab base.\n\n ---\n\nPresence Footsteps is also [**fully customisable**](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/wiki/Information-for-Resourcepack-Creators) using resourcepacks! Modders and users can assign their own materials, sounds, and stance to blocks and entities.","published":"2020-12-30T13:18:36.966588Z","updated":"2023-10-25T10:51:38.493781Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":754404,"followers":1824,"categories":["decoration"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.3","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.4","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.17-rc1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.2","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["BEtLdX9C","wl2DCPmO","iu4qJBKh","U0g0vHwf","r0Hz3hFo","3R7j6E4Z","20NGWQNM","2Dcs7kJq","cXdGDBED","HSI3wnPT","31QS6G6Z","gLDVmoRt","IUc6dyrf","9ZPyiU8N","3fEb2K4u","GExGOzbi","M7mmrOFn","M7xLhDyx","jxsFtML2","FMF3yzCR","KrTss88l","pOCYcZUF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rcTfTZr3/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"3fEb2K4u","project_id":"rcTfTZr3","author_id":"8a7Nm6u3","featured":true,"name":"PresenceFootsteps-1.6.4","version_number":"1.6.4","changelog":"- Backported fixes from [1.7.0](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/releases/tag/1.7.0)\n- Fixed crash when running alongside Pehkui #191","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-12-22T10:50:21.645382Z","downloads":256307,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"0bd6fbc394920839802827639e5073a86948d8db48553c334969ab35c7239610b1f0c4de703f0b1fbf15859db9630fae7ef9f12fb367bf87ad8890f4fa5c5d6f","sha1":"ca03578ac0ce30c50c9b644babe2db1c7125c669"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rcTfTZr3/versions/3fEb2K4u/PresenceFootsteps-1.6.4.jar","filename":"PresenceFootsteps-1.6.4.jar","primary":true,"size":7221534,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"hfsU4hXq","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"GvrerX1T","user":{"id":"8a7Nm6u3","username":"Sollace","name":"­Sollace","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6429283?v=4","bio":"­","created":"2020-12-01T08:11:42.703275Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"PresenceFootsteps-1.6.4.jar"},"mods\\ponderjs-1.19.2-1.2.0.jar":{"sha512":"0408aff7c9b6cbcc0685598834ec132467da05170f2b544e1407f73225c4a91f8bac0ac4dad96469a492ef48bd7a270977fcbddcf1e82a49d6400e02b60c2738","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"5A34Stj8","slug":"ponder","project_type":"mod","team":"gOZPohWq","title":"Ponder for KubeJS","description":"Create custom Ponder scenes with KubeJS.","body":"Create custom [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create) Ponder scenes with [KubeJS](https://modrinth.com/mod/kubejs).

An item that **scans** the right-clicked **block** and shows what season is currently affecting it.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\nApart from the greenhouse resources, Fabric Seasons: Extras adds **other blocks** such as:\n- Season Detector - **Redstone component** that outputs a redstone **signal** based on the **current season** and the block's configuration.\n- Season Calendar - Helpful **item/black** that can show you the season **progress** and how many **days** are left until the next season.\n\n### Other Information\n\nFor bug reporting please proceed to the mod's GitHub

Hopefully this will encourage you to farm a little bit of everything!\n\n### **IMPORTANT, BREAKING CHANGES on _1.2.0(MC1.18.2)_ and _1.3.1(MC1.19)_**\n> **This update is a major upgrade, I recommend that you make a backup of your world before updating to this version, because this version modifies identifiers of entities, blocks and items for pantries that have been renamed to cabinet. The mod will try to migrate, but will delete all pantries placed in inventory and world if it does not succeed to migrate.**\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**Follow the advancements!** Much of its progression is described through them. By default, press the (L) key to open the Advancements screen.\n\nIf you'd rather get a more straight-forward guide, we wrote a *__[Getting Started](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started)__* to help you learn the basics!\n\n\n## Beta Version\n\nThis mod is currently **under development**, so issues and instabilities may occur. If you'd like to play, keep in mind:\n* **Backup your saves often**;\n* Make sure everything is working before adding it to a modpack;\n* Report any issues you find to our **[issue tracker](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues)**! It helps us a lot!\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n***Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?***\n> Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n> * Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n> * Remember that this mod is in beta, so keep and eye out for major gameplay changes and additions that may happen between versions.\n\n***Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?***\n> Farmer's Delight will always keep up with the latest version of Minecraft, with temporary support for the previous one. As of now:\n> * The current focus is exclusively on version(s) : 1.19 and 1.18.2;\n> * This mod port will never be backported to any version prior to 1.16.5 (please don't ask further);\n\n***Q. Do you have a Patreon, or similar means of supporting your work?***\n> Not currently, but thanks for your consideration! I'm currently well-sustaned by a stable job, and my personal projects are hobbies I work on my free time. My suggestion is to donate your money to more worthy causes, or just treat yourself to a nice lunch. ;)\n\n\n## Links:\n\n* [Discord for Help and Feedbacks (Fabric version)](https://discord.gg/MskvEhPDQz)\n* [Report Issues](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues)\n* [Discord of main mod/author (Forge version)](https://discord.gg/eFsz5SK)\n* [Twitter vectorwing (original forge mod author)](https://twitter.com/vectorwing)","published":"2022-06-18T17:51:27.070187Z","updated":"2023-08-19T21:58:14.204663Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":264515,"followers":758,"categories":["decoration","food","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["FG4vSwZt","EpdWyovh","cRnlUfGm","yx8C6sef","BYSArmvd","vHfAq5KW","RSpZmgnD","GJJkeGOX","j28o9UzD","buJjlyP3","JMZ3SwVr","4POXSYDm","G8lpe9fB","baQ9tohQ","Zlgy4hSU","TSMy7brE","DzmY31OQ","cyNt2Gp3","lpeIiuMj","YFvijG6F","rlm3hWGx"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4EakbH8e/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"YFvijG6F","project_id":"4EakbH8e","author_id":"8ylDo0gI","featured":true,"name":"1.3.10.1 - 1.19-1.19.2","version_number":"1.3.10.1","changelog":"## 1.3.10.1 - 1.19-1.19.2 *[FD-1.2.0]*\n#### Required dependencies :\n* Fabric Loader : **0.14.10+1.19.2**\n* Fabric API : >= **0.67.0+1.19.2**\n\n#### Changelog :\n* fix NPE after eat some consumable items of Farmer's Delight **[#176](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues/176)**\n* add Mod Menu integration (that was previously removed by error)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-19T21:55:36.245239Z","downloads":32253,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"11c8ff55ce4b475002fb678ed81a74cd47064c5e","sha512":"360bc51131ab5ce9ef2f998e10e9dd6a5c605acaca7487ab025369eff717b4038881f2906cbfcdde4f14fc53e33c6858bcb8ee4609421dbce4b86770b0a12e35"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4EakbH8e/versions/YFvijG6F/farmers-delight-fabric-mc1.19-1.19.2-1.3.10.1.jar","filename":"farmers-delight-fabric-mc1.19-1.19.2-1.3.10.1.jar","primary":true,"size":2703836,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"hfsU4hXq","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"S5wyPP3c","user":{"id":"8ylDo0gI","username":"Zifiv","name":"KEVIN BEAUCORAL","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/833854?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-18T17:41:39.413791Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"farmers-delight-fabric-mc1.19-1.19.2-1.3.10.1.jar"},"mods\\kubejs-create-fabric-1902.2.4-build.46.jar":{"sha512":"7f1a343d88ae6929c9b408926568b21b1e51b049720057ba6ec2cd21ced318a5fa14f07547d13bb8b6d8681e95a274b2ce97bb6178efaae2836fcaaece73ba77","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"T38eAZQC","slug":"kubejs-create","project_type":"mod","team":"p2d14DeK","title":"KubeJS Create","description":"KubeJS Create integration","body":"[Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create) integration for [KubeJS](https://modrinth.com/mod/kubejs).

It can be either items or fluids\nInput doesn't have to be an array. It can be either ingredients or `Fluid.of('minecraft:water', 1000)` or `{fluidTag: 'some:fluid_tag', amount: 1000}`\n\n### `createMechanicalCrafting`\n\n`event.recipes.createMechanicalCrafting(output, pattern[], {patternKey: input})`\n\nThis recipe type is the same as regular crafting table shaped recipe\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createSequencedAssembly(output[], input, sequence[]) \n// output[] are your output items\n// input is your input item\n// sequence[] is an array of sequences. These sequences are \"regular\" recipes that are supported.\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createCrushing([\n  '2x minecraft:cobblestone',\n  'minecraft:redstone',\n  Item.of('minecraft:redstone').withChance(0.5)\n], 'minecraft:redstone_ore')\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createMixing('create:chromatic_compound', [\n  '#forge:dusts/glowstone',\n  '#forge:dusts/glowstone',\n  '#forge:dusts/glowstone',\n  'create:powdered_obsidian',\n  'create:powdered_obsidian',\n  'create:powdered_obsidian',\n  'create:polished_rose_quartz'\n]).superheated()\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createFilling('create:blaze_cake', [\n  'create:blaze_cake_base',\n  Fluid.of('minecraft:lava', 250)\n])\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createEmptying([\n  'minecraft:glass_bottle',\n  Fluid.of('create:honey', 250)\n], 'minecraft:honey_bottle')\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createMechanicalCrafting('minecraft:piston', [\n  'CCCCC',\n  'CPIPC',\n  'CPRPC'\n], {\n  C: '#forge:cobblestone',\n  P: '#minecraft:planks',\n  R: '#forge:dusts/redstone',\n  I: '#forge:ingots/iron'\n})\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createSequencedAssembly([ // start the recipe\n Item.of('6x create:large_cogwheel').withChance(32.0), // have this item be an output with a certain chance\n Item.of('create:brass_ingot').withChance(2.0), // have this item be an output with a certain chance\n 'minecraft:andesite', // have this item be a guaranteed output\n 'create:cogwheel', // have this item be a guaranteed output\n 'minecraft:stick', // have this item be a guaranteed output\n 'minecraft:iron_nugget' // have this item be a guaranteed output\n], 'create:brass_ingot', [ // 'create:brass_ingot' is the input.\n// the transitional item set by \"transitionalItem('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel')\" is the item that will be used during the recipe as the item that the input is using to transition to the output.\n event.recipes.createDeploying('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel', ['create:incomplete_large_cogwheel', '#minecraft:planks']), // like a normal recipe function, is used as a sequence step in this array.

Input and output have the transitional item\n]).transitionalItem('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel').loops(6) // set the transitional item and the loops (amount of repetitions)\n```\n\nIf you want to use your own transitional item in sequenced_assembly recipes, you must register it in startup event:\n\n```javascript\nonEvent('item.registry', event => {\n  // Texture for this item goes in kubejs/assets/kubejs/textures/item/my_part.png\n  event.create('my_part', 'create:sequenced_assembly').displayName('My Part')\n})\n```\n\nThen you would use ...`transitionalItem('kubejs:my_part')`...\n\n> Note! Mysterious Conversion recipes are client side only, so the only way to add them currently is using reflection with this code in client scripts (outside any event):\n\n```javascript\nlet MysteriousItemConversionCategory = java('com.simibubi.create.compat.jei.category.MysteriousItemConversionCategory')\nlet ConversionRecipe = java('com.simibubi.create.compat.jei.ConversionRecipe')\n\nMysteriousItemConversionCategory.RECIPES.add(ConversionRecipe.create('minecraft:apple', 'minecraft:carrot'))\nMysteriousItemConversionCategory.RECIPES.add(ConversionRecipe.create('minecraft:golden_apple', 'minecraft:golden_carrot'))\n```\n\n[![](https://kubejs.com/discord.png)](https://discord.gg/lat)","published":"2023-08-21T20:20:41.279415Z","updated":"2023-11-20T15:07:35.257690Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":6929,"followers":15,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":["library"],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["MO75e2sC","YN0T5Pmf","dvLO7wuv","T4V6Dm0l","cNEVOQ4q","bnvthbJW","uMNhEyBG","79c3Pl6W","VwLRcUBQ","Khlo8swW","b3ZbuHEY","eRR2DuIi","CDoBzOhr","qmHwp7h4","gUgBKKro","r6cVLbDS","I3cYQ3mX","pLyqKVXT","ftDL2MOo","XABryG8V","VszJSnhB","1INYEb9w","oRValdcl","mHfUZDSO","m9lk8iMr","65oHVwN8","VLiijTOY","rJ26X7G5","2Hq8tbrn","dxY7VzQv","zWLaf3WR","Yp60zntL","B4zWSIIO","8qUQlsto","zmzcrZEp","y7FC6Rsp","YE9yQwxx","353BVKVV","hYdnSDQB","13yE1QX6","Jqn5DRIj","A0KQFxde","Xe2y2pRp","FhVbUfLB","ClnUsQ85","HJ0xIlkM","PB33MOc1","hei9cDRa"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T38eAZQC/511b709655f4853df9ff9f3731fc1df6d2c4a20a.png"},"version":{"id":"HJ0xIlkM","project_id":"T38eAZQC","author_id":"7tgPcl7v","featured":false,"name":"KubeJS

(Thanks sschr15!)\n### 4.1.8\n- Added and fixed Chinese translations (thanks SolidBlock-cn!).\n### 4.1.7\n- Fixed the mod claiming it must be installed on the server on Forge. \n### 4.1.6\n- Updated to support Quilt hashed mappings.\n### 4.1.5\n- Fixed not working on Quilt. \n### 4.1.4 \n- Fixed the text of the crash screen sometimes being broken\n- Fixed not being able to use custom assets for the mod.

Crashy is a crash hosting site designed specifically for Not Enough Crashes and Minecraft crashes in general. \nIt shows crashes in an organized GUI that is easily readable, and has some other nice features. [Example](https://crashy.net/2c2vAe5oUVgiNck3NfXU).  \nThere is now a button for uploading directly to crashy in the crash screen. \n- Fixed UTF-specific characters turning into '?' when uploading crash logs.\n- Fixed 'Continuing the game after crashing will cause a crash report to be logged later when the game exits normally'.\n### 3.6.5\n- Forge for 1.17.1! As this is the first Forge version in a while it may have some issues, so comment if you've encountered anything (or better, open a Github issue).\n### 3.6.4\n- Added some Quilt-specific features, courtesy of @Siuolthepic!\n### 3.6.3\n- Quilt now absolutely, officially, works, just as well as Fabric does. \n### 3.6.2\n- Fixed text not being localized to English when the translation is not available for the chosen language.\n### 3.6.1\n- Should now work with the Quilt mod loader, with `deobfuscateStackTrace` set to false in the config.\n  Currently, catching initialization errors and deobfuscation is not supported in Quilt.\n## 3.6.0\n- ~~Should now work with the Quilt mod loader~~ not yet\n- Fixed Jar-in-jar mods not being blamed for crashes\n## 3.5.0\n- No longer depends on Fabric API for localization to work properly.\n### 3.4.5\n- Fixed some regressions in cleaning up after crash. This fixes not being disconnected from servers.\n### 3.4.4\n- Fixed integrated server crashes not being caught.\n- Fixed state sometimes not being cleaned up properly which could cause the game to infinitely crash.\n### 3.4.3\n- Fixed deobfuscation not working in dedicated servers, courtesy of @Fourmisain!\n### 3.4.2\n- Prevented extreme cases where the crash log could become incredibly large. \n- Fixed the crash screen not showing suspected mods in cases where adding them to the crash log was prevented by conflicting mods.\n### 3.4.1\n- Improved internal error message.\n## 3.4.0\n- Provided many configuration options for uploading the crash logs, see NecConfig.java, thanks to The456Gamer!\n- The config format for uploading crash logs has changed, refer to NecConfig.java for the new format. \n## 3.3.1\n- Fixed mod identification not working.\n- Fixed deobfuscation sometimes not working.\n- Promoted to Release!\n## 3.3.0\n- Updated to Minecraft 1.17, Java 16. \n- Currently buggy, this is a minimum viable alpha release.\n## 3.2.0\n- Added a new option `forceCrashScreen` that will prevent cases in which the game closes with no crash log. Instead, the game will crash normally.\n### 3.1.9\n- Fixed additional crash stack traces appearing when debugModIdentification is false. \n### 3.1.8\n- The 1.16.5 Fabric version will no longer deliberately crash in 1.17 snapshots. This means that it may work if nothing broke the mod in a snapshot.\n### 3.1.7\n- Added a new config option: debugModIdentification, that will hopefully help in discovering mods in more cases.\n### 3.1.6\n- (Forge) Fixed being unable to identify crashing mods that have multiple authors.\n### 3.1.5\n- Made it so the Curseforge page can be reached through the Mod Menu entry.\n### 3.1.4\n- Fixed Forge version not working at all.\n### 3.1.3\n- Made NEC more compatible with other mods, specifically with [Structure Gel API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/structure-gel-api).\n### 3.1.1\n- Fixed mod not loading.\n## 3.1.0\n- Added extra info for feature/structure crashes to make it much easier to find the problematic mod, courtesy of TelepathicGrunt!.\n# 3.0.0\n- Now supports Forge!\n## 2.2.0\n- Removed 'feature' that would instantly crash the game when pressing F3+C instead of after 6 seconds, since that hotkey is used to copy location information.\n- Added a proper mod icon.\n### 2.1.4\n- Improved Simplified Chinese localization, courtesy of @WuzgXY!\n### 2.1.3\n- Fixed \"upload crashlog\" not working :) .\n### 2.1.1\n- Fixed \"upload crashlog\" not working.\n## 2.1.0\n- Added Estonian localization, courtesy of @Madis0!\n# 2.0.0\n- Fixed the mod not working in Fabric Loader 0.9.0+, however, this and the following versions will only work for the 0.9.0+ Fabric Loader versions.\n### 1.2.4\n- Will no longer blame jumploader for errors all the time\n### 1.2.3\n- Fixed an incompatibility with LambdaControls (mostly just a mistake, not really an incompatibility).\n- Crash logs will now be uploaded as gists instead of to the dimdev haste.

Because of some problems with world presets, you should not use the vanilla world presets. Instead use the forceLargeBiomes option, found in the WWOO config.\n- A config menu is available if you install [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) and on fabric also [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu).\n- The overworld isn't piglin safe.

It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n# 📈 Benchmarks\n\nThe following performance comparisons have been contributed by our community, and they show how Sodium can improve frame rates for a wide range of computers, whether fast or slow. Many of our players report a **250% to 500% increase** in average frame rates.\n\n- AMD Ryzen 5 5600H / NVIDIA RTX 3050 Ti ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142405940545585233/2023-08-19_12.24.14.png) 34 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142405941036331019/2023-08-19_12.27.45.png) 253 fps) [7.4x faster]\n- AMD Ryzen 5 5600 / NVIDIA RTX 3070 Ti ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1141912049392296046/2023-08-17_21.46.37.png) 62 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1141912050084347914/2023-08-17_21.48.26.png) 516 fps) [8.3x faster]\n- Intel Xeon E5-1620v3 / AMD RX 6400 ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142235253193318441/2023-08-19_00.50.49.png) 52 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142235253738586234/2023-08-19_01.14.25.png) 216 fps) [4.1x faster]\n- AMD Ryzen 3450U / AMD Vega 8 Graphics ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1141919288047976448/2023-08-17_22.15.37.png) 49 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1141919288542892254/2023-08-17_22.18.12.png) 118 fps) [2.4x faster]\n- Intel Core i5-11400 / Intel UHD 730 Graphics ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142235069117890731/2023-08-19_05.07.07.png) 39 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142235069747048511/2023-08-19_04.55.38.png) 110 fps) [2.8x faster]\n- Intel Core i3-4170 / NVIDIA GeForce GT 710 ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142286136782372984/2023-08-19_10.27.03.png) 38 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142286137050791986/2023-08-19_10.23.28.png) 86 fps) [2.2x faster]\n- Intel Celeron G5900 / Intel UHD Graphics 610 ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142299880228925530/2023-08-18_23.10.08.png) 62 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142299880656736337/2023-08-18_23.08.18.png) 155 fps) [2.5x faster]\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://i.imgur.com/Fud5oyF.png))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison above water](https://i.imgur.com/z9HBcvq.png), [comparison below water](https://i.imgur.com/QQMuOTy.png).) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://i.imgur.com/lYmlmgq.png)) which helps to make everything look smoother.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform

area (8->16radius))\n+ Tweaked indicator particle\n+ Tweaked Warped Anchor (TEleportation range increases depending on the charge level, chorus fruit works with warped anchor)\n+ Lichen moss can lit up if there's a redstone signal nearby\n+ Inventory order change\n+ Changed Glow Flare Recipe\n+ Increased glow ink clumps' light level\n+ Spectre spawning change (Spawns on top of a blocktag named \"spectres_spawn_on\")\n+ Bottling spectre will now save all the data (User that previously controls the spectre, pregnancy, breeding cooldown... etc)\n+ Added new spectre texture (Only renders when spectre is being spectated)\n+ Monstrometer emits a level of redstone signal in respect of the number of highlighted monsters\n+ Monstrometer can now be activated with redstone\n+ Added Sound Waves

lichen shelf sounds\n+ Added Combustion Table sounds\n\n**Mobs**\n+ Ported Sparkle & Spectre to use the brain AI\n+ Added specterpillar\n+ Spectre now likes lichen shelf, so you can now breed them.\n+ Once they have successfully breed it, they will find the nearest lichen moss and lay a specterpillar on top of the block\n+ Specterpillar will always stay in their own form, unless if you feed it with lichen shelf. After they stop producing bonemeal particle, they will move to the nearest lichen moss and burrow into it. Once they've succesffuly burrowed into the block, they will place a lichen cordyceps with a little animation.\n+ After that process, you have to wait for 5 minutes. During this period, they'll have a chance to start grow longer, and they will change the top texture to a lit texture after 4 mintues. Once 5 minutes have passed, the block will break and it will spawn a spectre.\n\n**Worldgen**\n+ Added gravel patch to lichen caves\n+ Added large silver ores to crystal canyons\n+ Made silver ores spawn in a smaller size","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-09T04:11:23.751315Z","downloads":4403,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"22c5e951fbc87b94c09b2d367943cbd244b24223","sha512":"88d8505bfd49019d4659753af155ad9e0dd61f347c67ffc4ac3afe48356cfd4191581b0fd2a0e56043574857ce8acf79df617a72321ccc0344836aef79f36899"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Kn7xyQ1v/versions/OiOtfscD/Galosphere-1.19.2-1.3.0-Fabric.jar","filename":"Galosphere-1.19.2-1.3.0-Fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":12051871,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"HgGdCpvr","user":{"id":"Yq8ublDx","username":"bunten","name":"bunten","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Yq8ublDx/d805b85b430281bf8c7aa12a2ded004018b6f519.png","bio":"iam developing\r\n","created":"2020-12-01T23:05:47.969541Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Sound Designer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"HgGdCpvr","user":{"id":"SRKJvluF","username":"Orcinus","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/SRKJvluF/6bc2c0d9ba49c8fc01ca93000e8b0696480a55e3.png","bio":"","created":"2021-12-04T03:54:57.699849Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"HgGdCpvr","user":{"id":"pcavjK69","username":"Ninni","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64173061?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-12-03T14:55:31.295258Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Galosphere-1.19.2-1.3.0-Fabric.jar"},"mods\\grabbymobs-1.19.2-1.2.jar":{"sha512":"8fbc1f48529c97c06d783f1534af78719505658a2cb93794cddb88647cec1f57810a08336c0476ce33b2cdbbd4273f3331b057de2d1b333bead9eabcf8429b26","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"O6Sh7btX","slug":"grabby-mobs","project_type":"mod","team":"Dj233iu2","title":"Grabby Mobs","description":"👾 Allows all mobs which can carry equipment to pick up items from the floor.","body":"<p><a href=\"https://serilum.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://github.com/ricksouth/serilum-mc-mods/raw/master/description/Modrinth/header.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"428\" /></a><br /><br /><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Requires the library mod&nbsp;<a style=\"font-size: 24px;\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/collective\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Collective</a>.<br /></span></strong></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Grabby Mobs makes changes to the game mechanics, specifically of mobs in-game.

What about Resource Packs?\n  - Falling Leaves _should_ be 100% compatible with any modded trees and any resource pack changing leaves!\n\n- Does this need to be installed on the server for multiplayer?\n  - Nope! This mod is 100% client-side.\n\n- Lol fabric suxxx gief forge plx.\n  - Cheaterpaul [ported this mod to Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-forge \"Forge port\"), note that this port is inofficial and might not always be up-to-date, it also does configuration differently.\n\n- Do you have any screenshots I could look at before I install this?\n  - Sure! Check out the [images section](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-fabric/screenshots) of this mod's Curseforge page.  \n    (Note that they are slightly out of date.)\n\n- I enjoy old things. Can you backport this to Minecraft 1.7?\n  - No. We will only focus on supporting the most recently released version of Minecraft.\n\n- I found a problem / have an idea! Do I just post a comment on your CurseForge page?\n  - You **could**, but we'd prefer it if you posted an issue on [our GitHub repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/RandomMcSomethin/fallingleaves/issues).  \n    It makes it far easier for us to follow up when developing new versions of this mod.\n\n- Can I include this mod in my modpack?\n  - Absolutely! Just remember to put a link to our CurseForge page somewhere in your modpack's documentation.\n\n- What do you get if you jumble the letters in \"Falling Leaves Mod\"?\n  - You get \"Five Golden Llamas\".

Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.\n\nFor support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).\n\n## Using Fabric API to play with mods\n\nMake sure you have install fabric loader first. More information about installing Fabric Loader can be found [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/).\n\nThe downloaded jar file should be placed in your `mods`

However, the new structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.\n\n3.  **Is this mod for Forge or Fabric/Quilt?**\nCTOV is available for all three mod loaders: Forge, Fabric, and Quilt.\n\n4.  **How can I locate the new structures?**\nTo locate the new structures, you can use the `/locate` command.\n    For 1.18.2, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate ctov:\\[structure\\_from\\_list\\] <br>\n\n    For 1.19+, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate structure ctov:[structure_from_list] <br>\n\n    The `[structure_from_list]` part of the command is the name of the structure that you want to locate. You can find a list of all the available structures in the CTOV documentation.\n\n5.  **Does CTOV modify existing vanilla structures?**\nThe only structures that are modified by CTOV are vanilla villages in older versions. In newer versions, CTOV creates its own structures that are separate from vanilla villages.\n\n6.  **What about the loot of these structures?**\nThe vast majority of structures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility. However, they also use some custom loot tables to integrate said structures into the world better. You will still find pillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as well as bells, workstations, etc., but you may also find new stuff like food, armour, and other goodies.\n\n7.  **How can I report bugs/issues/suggestions?**\nTo report bugs, issues, or suggestions, please go to the CTOV GitHub repo and create an issue. You can also message the mod author on Discord.\n\n8.  **Can I include CTOV in my modpack?**\nYes, you can include CTOV in your modpack. However, please be sure to give credit to the mod author and provide a link to their page.\n\n9.  **Can I have CTOV for 1.x.x, please?**\nIf it's lower than 1.18.2, no. Please don't ask this question. The technical limit is too high here.\n\n10.  **Can I give Choicetheorem any commission or support?**\nThe mod author does not accept commissions or monetary support. They are doing this as a hobby and do not want to be paid for their work.\n\nI hope this answers all of your questions.\n</details>\n\n**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER4.webp)**\n\n\n**ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village (CTOV) is compatible with most world-generation and structure mods.** It also works with Guard Villager and other structure packs by ChoiceTheorem. Mods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs.\n\nHere are some more details about the compatibility of CTOV with other mods:\n\n-   **World-generation mods:** CTOV relies on vanilla biome Tags, so almost all world-generation mods like Terralith, Oh Biome You'll Go, and Biomes O'plenty will have appropriate CTOV villages in their biomes.\n-   **Structure mods:** Various structure mods like Town&Tower and Repurposed structures also work well with CTOV. However, it is important to exercise caution when using too many mods, as this can cause instability. The same applies to Better Village.\n-   **Other mods:** Any other mod that doesn't affect villages and villagers will be compatible by default. Mods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs, which can be found on the Modrinth website.\n\n<details><summary>Mod integration</summary>\n\n-   [✓] **Waystone and Bountiful are compatible as is for latest versions of CTOV.**\n-   [✓] [**Farmer's delight**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-farmers-delight-compat)\n-   [✓] [**More villagers**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-more-villagers-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Croptopia**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-croptopia-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Friend and Foe**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-friends-and-foes-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Immersive Engineering**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-immersive-engineering-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Incubation**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-incubation-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Chef's delight**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-chefs-delight-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Beautify**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-beautify-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Vampirism**](https://modrinth.com/mod/vampirism-integrations)\n-   [✓] [**Domestication Innovation**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-domesticated-innovation-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Wizards**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-wizards-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Villager Plus**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-villagers-plus-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Advance peripheral**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-advanced-peripheral-compat)\n-   [✓] [**BYG**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-byg-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Savage and Ravage**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-savage-and-ravage-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Vending Machine**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-vending-machine-compat)\n-   [✓] [**All bark All bite**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-abab-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Gazebos**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-gazebo-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Paladins & Priests**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-paladins-n-priests-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Paragliders**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-paragliders-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Pneumatic craft**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-pneumaticcraft-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Jelly Fishing**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-jellyfishing-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Iron's Spells 'n Spellbooks**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-irons-spells-n-spellbooks-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Monobank**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-monobank-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Wares**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-wares-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Etches**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-etched-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Floralis**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-floralis-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Rats**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-rats-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Create structures**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-create-structures)\n-   [ ] Questager -

Scan results are visualized for a short while in a clean and readable manner, either as in-world highlights or appropriately positioned overlays. Did I mention eye candy yet? What results are shown depends on the modules in the scanner. Up to three modules may be installed at the same time. Default modules include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>animal detection (e.g. cows, pigs)</li>\n<li>monster detection (e.g. zombies, creepers)</li>\n<li>entity detection (configurable to a specific entity)</li>\n<li>common ore detection (e.g. coal, iron)</li>\n<li>rare ore detection (e.g. gold, diamond)</li>\n<li>fluid detection (e.g. water, lava)</li>\n<li>block detection (configurable to a specific block)</li>\n<li>range booster</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unless disabled in the config, the scanner will act as a chargeable item, using the Forge energy API. The energy consumed for each scan depends on the modules installed in the scanner. The scanner can be recharged in any charger mod block that is compatible with the Forge energy API.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, there's - you guessed it - eye candy. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yXUJY2GuCRc\">Here's a quick video</a> demonstrating the mod.</p>\n<p>A few words on performance: it is great. The server does none of the actual scanning computation, so using the scanner cannot lag servers (clients will always respect server settings though). Furthermore, scanning is distributed across several ticks (hence the charging time when using the scanner), so even on the client using the scanner there should be no noticeable impact. As for rendering, the scan wave effect is rendered using a shader and a single quad. This means it's super fast and should have no noticeable impact on FPS. Also tested on a very old laptop with no dip in FPS. Mileage when using OptiFine will vary, no guarantees it'll work.</p>\n<p>Other mods can provide additional modules to generate different kind of scan results. If you have an idea for a module, either open an issue on this project's issue tracker or if it involves another mod, try to talk the mod's author into adding support for Scannable. They'll love that.

the box, TSmithing makes **every damageable vanilla item repairable** and **every vanilla equipment upgradeable** (yes, even chain).\n\nAs a result of these changes, it's easier to enchant and name your tools much earlier - keeping them in good condition with repairs and small improvements.\n\nIf particularly desired, the more limited version 1.0.1 also comes as an [NBT Crafting 2 datapack](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/sisby-folk/tinkerers-smithing/tree/nbtc2/src/main/resources) - see the [old readme](https://github.com/sisby-folk/tinkerers-smithing/blob/nbtc2-experiments/README.md) for a rough idea of what's in there.\n\n## Recipe Types\n\n### Tweaked\n\n**Anvil Unit Repair**<br/>\n*This

Sacrificial Upgrade**<br/>\nUpgrade straight to 'gilded' tiers (netherite) by sacrificing an existing item of that tier.<br/>\n![javaw_sJbMWenD1D](https://github.com/sisby-folk/tinkerers-smithing/assets/55819817/b3908f7b-8acf-4570-bce8-79f7aec5c83a)\n\n## Design - Vanilla Recipe Cost\n\n### Repairing\n- Shapeless repair from 0 to full costs the same as a fresh craft. 1 unit repairs 1/3 of a pickaxe.\n- Anvil repair keeps anvil balancing - One unit repairs 25% no matter what.\n- [Default Datapack] Netherite is repaired using diamonds instead of netherite ingots.\n\n### Upgrading\n- Shapeless upgrades cost the same units as the fresh tool. Great for going wood -> stone -> iron.\n    - As a convenience cost, damage to the tool will be \"passed on\" to the new tool - as if left in the handle.\n- Smithing upgrades cost as much as the full cost, or up to four less, leveraging repair mechanics.\n    - An iron chestplate upgraded with 5 diamonds will have 25% durability, requiring 3 more in repairs to reach full.\n- Sacrificial upgrades cost one tool of the same tier, and have durability based on the cost of the ungilded equipment.\n    - A half durability netherite boots \"sacrifices\" two diamonds to the recipe, enough for a full sword, or a 1/4 durability chestplate.\n\n## Design - Vanilla Progression and Mending\n\nIn vanilla, as you enchant and combine a tool on the anvil, it becomes exponentially more expensive as it accrues \"work\"/`RepairCost` - Eventually, any tool becomes unworkable.\nThis means endgame gear must be instead made by repeatedly enchanting and un-enchanting for good RNG, then adding books (like mending).  Even repair inflicts prior work - forcing players to rush a mending villager.\n\nThis ruins the idea of having \"sentimental\" gear you improve and maintain over time.\n\nInstead of nerfing mending, TSmithing buffs everything else, altering balance as follows:\n\n- Adds three new non-RNG methods to obtaining endgame gear\n    - Early game gear can be gradually combined with books, other gear, and netherite scrap.\n    - Enchanted golden treasure can be combined and upgraded to netherite.\n    - Enchanted gear can be bought from villagers and combined, then upgraded.\n- Adds one additional RNG-based method to obtain endgame gear: upgrading table-enchanted golden gear.\n    - At the point of having netherite, this is less of an issue as its enchantability is higher.\n    - Netherite scrap can also be used to continue combining already powerful gear, nerfing this strategy by proxy.\n- Obsidian / Ancient Debris can be mined after obtaining only one diamond.\n- Netherite gear can technically be exchanged for other netherite gear (removes enchantments).\n\n\n## Data-driven Recipes\n\nTinkerer's Smithing 2.0 includes built-in data for vanilla, along with the below mods:\n\n[Yttr](https://modrinth.com/mod/yttr) | [Farmer's Delight](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight-fabric) | [Botania](https://modrinth.com/mod/botania) | [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric) | [Chalk](https://modrinth.com/mod/chalk) | [Campanion](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight-fabric) | [Consistency+](https://modrinth.com/mod/consistencyplus)\n\nRecipes are driven by defining **Tool Materials**, **Armor Materials**, **Equipment Types**, and **Unit Cost Overrides**.\n\n - **Materials** draw from materials in the code, and can inherit them from an item. They define upgrade paths e.g. Iron->Diamond.\n   - By default, all vanilla materials are added (wood, stone, leather, chain, iron, gold, diamond, netherite)\n - **Types** define which items are \"alike\". Items with a material upgrade path and a matching type will create upgrade recipes.\n   - By default, the 5 tools (e.g. `c:swords`) and 4 armor slots have defined types.\n - **Unit Cost Overrides** allow you to override how much (and of what) an item costs to repair in-grid or upgrade to.\n\nFurther documentation will be made once 2.0 sures up a bit, but feel free to look at the [built-in datapack](https://github.com/sisby-folk/tinkerers-smithing/tree/1.19/src/main/resources/data)\n\n### Afterword\n\nAll mods are built on the work of many others.\n\nThis mod is included in [Tinkerer's Quilt](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about rediscovering vanilla.\n\nTextures shown include [xali's books](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xalis-enchanted-books), [Sully's Peeves](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/sullys-peeves) and [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs/)' degrading tools\n\nWe're open to suggestions for how to implement stuff better - if you see something wonky and have an idea - let us know.\n","published":"2022-08-12T13:35:37.960239Z","updated":"2023-09-22T06:39:04.943516Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":9610,"followers":97,"categories":["equipment","game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["47M8Z99K","Wq3kcPeP","lUZj4sZ1","MIl5odZQ","2VwaGi5h","FnT4z0wn","ns3qD3Eq","hLBYU1NO","l4hnfTE5","Z41fsNcD","BReFppkV","RnoUuxqz","kFzgHIQn","LwnIYSbo","gH9ShEJU","hKTgpX9q","EJ3rtnUD","BdNhlyzS","hvzFqGMd","oadvTTHY","V3sf9Cjk","ghD5IX4Z","r3cVZq7u","MztwJUY6","c5C2qVnY","BwDd8HnI","Zc77heww","gigxZAOG","ISfxfwNW","kPzbfMNT","FkrCV6cM","u0XMz5ro","j3Mj6Hn4","qpPevVmy","1EK0NJlq","zlVePtuZ","5z6R0JXV","7Hqa5gJW","naceFkYV","StYzNuAC","OrHKWels","eMdZ2OWK","s35mzIoc","vL5KsFLO","wromkYNn","TB6Zsv1c","EwtSOjkP","1UcMRWHH","4oXhns6s","tautHSWa","XjrdYn33","l09g3hXa","CbmPpBc9","IDqa5tI0","DOHu6c1b","6Dxf92xx","TRfCHBN9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/RhVpNN5O/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"CbmPpBc9","project_id":"RhVpNN5O","author_id":"HrZk20E5","featured":false,"name":"2.5.1","version_number":"2.5.1+1.19","changelog":"Updates to broken items:\n - Broken items are no longer affected by enchantments other than mending - including sillk touch, and curse of binding.\n   - The only logic that should be adversely affected by this is the XP refund calculation for combining items at a grindstone.\n - Vanilla broken elytra are now consisdered broken, showing tooltips etc.\n - Connector compatibility plugin removed - the whole mod now works on connector, including broken items.\n\nChangelog: https://github.com/sisby-folk/tinkerers-smithing/releases/tag/v2.5.1","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-08T04:38:58.972461Z","downloads":485,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"d53d53f75f5449d1945250e1db904fb32a566326996b71caf43a41969240e89609458f0d4acea72b113df2626a70403d653df21f510b539ce9f900e0a39b30a3","sha1":"621730ac340dc8119118f3910adab478c0af1870"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/RhVpNN5O/versions/CbmPpBc9/tinkerers_smithing-2.5.1%2B1.19.jar","filename":"tinkerers_smithing-2.5.1+1.19.jar","primary":true,"size":171888,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"fRiHVvU7","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"siSTpX2u","user":{"id":"HrZk20E5","username":"sisby-folk","name":"Nora H","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/HrZk20E5/icon.png","bio":"A handful of technicolor monsters.\n\nFound on discord through unascribed's guild and prism.\n\nhttps://tech.lgbt/@sleepingdragoninn","created":"2021-04-17T05:28:15.123494Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"tinkerers_smithing-2.5.1+1.19.jar"},"mods\\rhino-fabric-1902.2.2-build.280.jar":{"sha512":"805e8f7e5ae65b012acb228aa83efc5518f255e26ed8c45a709151fd85647ed35ca9fb1999ed2708d9e1f78037b65f5ae03a70db6f83d68ccc4e3a531f04f7db","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"sk9knFPE","slug":"rhino","project_type":"mod","team":"zzKhfQN9","title":"Rhino","description":"A fork of Mozilla's Rhino library, modified for use in mods","body":"A fork of Mozilla's Rhino library, modified for use in mods.

takes Minecraft's 1.18 massive world generation overhaul, and turns it up to eleven.\n\n![terralith_banner_squashed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224816673-7f074733-da85-4673-a7b0-3362651c4dbd.png)\n\n## Notes\n- Terralith is *technically* compatible with William Wyther's Overhauled Overworld, Biomes O' Plenty, and Oh The Biomes You'll Go; but it requires Terrablender, which screws with the biome distribution\n- Terralith is compatible with Tectonic, if you use [Apollo](https://github.com/ApolloDatapacks)'s [Terratonic](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/terratonic/)\n- Do not add this to an existing world - reset yours first, or use a new world\n- View the structures and biomes per seed using [jacobsjo](https://github.com/jacobsjo)'s [Minecraft Datapack Map](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/)\n\n## Description\n### Biomes\nTerralith adds over 95 brand new biomes, as well as updating almost every vanilla biome with new and improved features. There are also new terrain types: canyons, shattered biomes, floating islands, deep ocean trenches, and much, much more.\n\n**Yellowstone** is one of Terralith's staple biomes - a simple and beautiful landscape, based on the real life US National Park. Among the list of realistic biomes are **Yosemite Cliffs**, **Shield**, and many more depending on what you're looking for in a biome. **Highlands** and its variants offer a flat surface to create on - builders can imagine anything from huge mega cities to small simple cottages. Adventurers can explore the breath-taking **Volcanic Peaks** and discover the beautiful **Desert Oases**.\n\nWhile realistic biomes can remind us of the beautiful planet we live on, Terralith offers a plunge into the world of fantasy as well. Adventurers can wander through the purple and mystical **Moonlight Grove** and **Amethyst Rainforest**, or climb the unforgiving cliffs of the **Scarlet Mountains**. If determined, sailers can find the mysterious **Mirage Isles**, or even the elusive and nostalgic **Alpha Islands**. Terralith encourages imagination to run wild here.\n\nIf you feel the surface is too face, have no fear - custom caves lurk beneath your feet! Similar to Minecraft's Lush Cave, the **Underground Jungle** is full of foliage, and rarely some old abandoned houses. Other caves, like **Infested** and **Fungal Caves** are overgrown with spiders and fungi! If you dig super deep, you could stumble upon a sister to the Deep Dark: the **Frostfire Caves** are dangerous and menacing. Beware!\n\n### Structures\nTo tie all of Terralith's magnificent biomes together are it's structures. The ominous tall **Spire** pierces the sky in the iciest biomes. Rarely, you can find **Fortified Villages** in the plains and desert - the villagers have progressed quite far as a society! Finally, if you find yourself lost at night, cold and hungry, you might stumble into the warm protection of the simple Glacial Hut.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","published":"2022-11-13T21:48:54.507121Z","updated":"2023-10-29T14:01:22.889842Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":229919,"followers":1005,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["Q9qUUqA7","Wd3Co0mZ","81tshMIZ","Xf5mFGCS","jUK1mCz3","1latp88m","pNFzTzQd","mLdNNka6","K3S6BASh","aYOzrVFZ","Y4i2gvLB","D0hKeWDQ","JT2esX5R","8N8lLvTW","34PhE3zd","2w1uZoRC","PNByHzei","WZvndtxX","UJtMNPNx","Rq2BBA8A","hYoo0DKV","CDrDiFNK","qFd4s3fV","FOe2l0tx","IWVbiEbl","1hOeraaL"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/34c751cc804839ed3c1d9f21dfd53d98368fedfc.png"},"version":{"id":"FOe2l0tx","project_id":"8oi3bsk5","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v2.3.12 ~ 1.19.3","version_number":"2.3.12","changelog":"# Terralith v2.3.12\n- Fix a [Feature Order Cycle](https://github.com/UHQ-GAMES-MODS/REGIONS_UNEXPLORED_FORGE/issues/50) with [Regions Unexplored](https://modrinth.com/mod/regions-unexplored)\n- Reword the \"welcome toast\" to be clear what the Discord link is for.

For example, one goal is to allow sorters consisting of a mixture of vanilla and modded hoppers, ducts, etc. to behave predictably.\n\n## How Does it Do it?\nThe mod provides an interface to implement and a method to call when a cooldown should be triggered.  The method may safely be called with any BlockEntity as its argument.  When the target BE implements the interface, it will be notified of the cooldown and can take whatever action it deems appropriate.  When this mod is installed, descendants of HopperBlockEntity which do not override HBE's insert() and innermost transfer() methods automatically implement the interface and will coordinate with other implementing BEs.\n\n## How to Use this Library \nThere are some important details (f.e. how to know when a cooldown should be triggered) which implementors need to get right in order for coordination to work properly.  See the library's javadocs, or take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/gniftygnome/cooldown-coordinator/wiki).\n\n## Future Goals\nI would like this mod or something similar to be part of the Fabric API.  At present, it is somewhere between an RFC and a WIP.  If it performs as intended and there is interest from the Fabric community, I intend to maintain the mod until (and beyond) it becomes part of Fabric or something better comes along.\n","published":"2022-03-14T03:56:38.374661Z","updated":"2023-06-26T17:19:23.194769Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":4266,"followers":11,"categories":["library","storage"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.19-pre1","1.19-pre2","1.19-pre3","1.19-pre4","1.19-pre5","1.19-rc1","1.19-rc2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.2","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20-pre3","1.20-pre4","1.20-pre5","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","23w14a","23w16a","23w17a","23w18a"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["RZ5LHtuZ","WLNZJmN7","1KUZ0GAa","kCn6knZM","MuY3HiSq","ATEAtk37","kFdy7ox5","FqxeicxG","UAzceuW2","UeuqnE5a","LIWIbrVl","wVepCY46","DfR52Hhg"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/2lfPteTN/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"UAzceuW2","project_id":"2lfPteTN","author_id":"qtMYDuLg","featured":false,"name":"Cooldown Coordinator 0.4.3 for Minecraft 1.19, 1.19.1, 1.19.2","version_number":"0.4.3","changelog":"Version 0.4.3\n\n* Disable recent breaking Lithium Hopper optimizations for now.\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-12-03T22:18:55.483823Z","downloads":536,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"b8f01f78e703a1cbc9f5ac3801e63b9ec639d76d529971f1cce69185098c4a38f10f107f812485b74482f504f59a2b8631b9d25798ca7f9cd199fb760f98568e","sha1":"07a69542caf4bb09978e7e07954068427ab4560a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/2lfPteTN/versions/UAzceuW2/cooldown-coordinator-0.4.3.jar","filename":"cooldown-coordinator-0.4.3.jar","primary":true,"size":13917,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"0af985c1f3c6b94631422f33b387ed9f1c50f0aa","sha512":"ccb57f39d5db9f202ada673791458c68d94d1fd5d8bd92d51927be53573c4829510de9460a1dd7a07c84c593ae199ae4ccaed8b54ae401350366a950a7dfd354"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/2lfPteTN/versions/UAzceuW2/cooldown-coordinator-0.4.3-sources.jar","filename":"cooldown-coordinator-0.4.3-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":12883,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"HidfQBm9","user":{"id":"qtMYDuLg","username":"gniftygnome","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50962022?v=4","bio":"GniftyGnome is a Minecraft enthusiast and server administrator.","created":"2022-02-04T22:22:15.295324Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"cooldown-coordinator-0.4.3.jar"},"datapacks\\Create Structures - v0.1.0.zip":{"sha512":"c6d82a7ff728a750185ee6808d72b505e34df46d61679ed4b1fd766f00a23348642c076845550e5fb0bd9e89a9c8a40d58863cb89a8470158037e24806bfa92b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"IAnP4np7","slug":"create-structures","project_type":"mod","team":"vOSEG6yu","title":"Create: Structures","description":"Add-on for Create that implements naturally generating structures containing early-game Create contraptions and items.","body":"Create: Structures is an add-on for Create that intends to further integrate the mod into vanilla by adding naturally generating structures. \n\nWARNING: This datapack uses command blocks to assemble contraptions, since Create doesn't properly support generated structures.\n\nThese structures are built in the vanilla building style, while also utilizing blocks and items from the create mod.

This mod also adds the Borderless Windowed option to the Video Settings screen, so you can easily disable the mod ingame, and has a configuration menu accessible through Mod Menu.\n\n\nWorks on vanilla servers, and modded servers without the mod installed!\n\n\nThis mod is a rewrite of a Forge 1.12 mod, [Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-windowed-borderless-for-minecraft), however it used to be a fork of that mod (which the 1.12 version of this mod is) - see the bottom of this page for the original description.\n\n\nSee [Borderless Window](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/borderless) by nekeras if you're looking for a similar mod for Forge 1.14+.\n\n\nOn macOS this mod is disabled by default, as it is impossible to position the window above the menu bar, and macOS has better fullscreen support anyway.\n\n\n<details><summary>Old 1.12.2 mod description</summary>\n\nThis is the latest released version (1.6.0) of the mod [Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-windowed-borderless-for-minecraft) by hancin for MC 1.12-1.12.2, plus a fix for window resizing by me, compiled by Brycey92. This fork will be obsolete if [this PR](https://github.com/hancin/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/pull/27) is merged.\n\nThis fixes the bug where the window is not resizable after exiting fullscreen. This is a bug in LWJGL, and is fixed by [Fullscreen Fix](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-fix) and in current versions of Forge. However, the existing fixes are not applied to Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless), so this fork fixes it in that mod.\n\nSee the original Github post by Brycey92 [here](https://github.com/Brycey92/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/releases/tag/1.6.0-1).\n\nThe 1.12.2 build had the following links: [Source](https://github.com/comp500/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft), [Issues](https://github.com/comp500/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/issues)\n\n**The 1.12.2 build is licensed under the following license:**\n\nCopyright (c) 2015-2017, David Larochelle-Pratte\\\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\\\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1\\.
